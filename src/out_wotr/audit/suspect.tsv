Channeling energy causes a burst that either heals all living creatures or damages all undead creatures in a 30-foot radius centered on the cleric. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to {g|Encyclopedia:Dice}1d6{/g} points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every two cleric levels beyond 1st (2d6 at 3rd, 3d6 at 5th, and so on). Creatures that take damage from channeled energy receive a {g|Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw}Will save{/g} to halve the damage. The {g|Encyclopedia:DC}DC{/g} of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the cleric's level + the cleric's {g|Encyclopedia:Charisma}Charisma{/g} modifier. Creatures healed by channel energy cannot exceed their maximum {g|Encyclopedia:HP}hit point{/g} total — all excess healing is lost. A cleric may channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.
This is a {g|Encyclopedia:Standard_Actions}standard action{/g} that does not provoke an {g|Encyclopedia:Attack_Of_Opportunity}attack of opportunity{/g}. A cleric can choose whether or not to include herself in this effect.
A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a good deity) can also channel stored {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g} energy into healing spells that she did not prepare ahead of time. The cleric can "lose" any prepared spell that is not an {g|Encyclopedia:Cantrips_Orisons}orison{/g} or domain spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with "cure" in its name).	Dobrý kněz (nebo neutrální kněz, který uctívá dobré božstvo) kanáluje pozitivní energii a může zvolit, zda způsobí {g|Encyclopedia:Damage}poškození{/g} nemrtvým tvorům, nebo {g|Encyclopedia:Healing}uzdraví{/g} živé.	too_short:0.13
2811	A separatist selects one domain from her deity's domain list, and a second domain that is not on her deity's domain list. This second domain cannot be an {g|Encyclopedia:Alignment}alignment{/g} domain that doesn't match the cleric's or her deity's alignment. For example, a lawful good separatist cleric of a neutral good deity cannot choose the Chaos or Evil domain with this ability, but can select the Law domain even though her deity isn't lawful.
Granted powers from the cleric's second domain function as if the cleric's level, {g|Encyclopedia:Wisdom}Wisdom{/g}, and {g|Encyclopedia:Charisma}Charisma{/g} were 2 lower than normal (minimum level 1) in terms of effect, {g|Encyclopedia:DC}DC{/g}, and uses per day. This also means the separatist doesn't gain the domain's higher-level ability until 2 levels later than normal. If the second domain grants additional class {g|Encyclopedia:Skills}skills{/g}, the separatist gains these as normal.
In all other respects, this ability works like and replaces the standard cleric's domain ability.	Ve všech ostatních ohledech tato schopnost funguje stejně jako a nahrazuje standardní doménovou schopnost kněze.	too_short:0.11

This source can represent a blood relation or an extreme event involving a creature somewhere in the family's past. For example, an eldrich scion might have a dragon as a distant relative or her grandfather might have signed a terrible contract with a devil. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways as the eldrich scion gains levels. An eldrich scion must pick one bloodline upon taking her first level of eldrich scion. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.
Filled with magical power that screams for release, sorcery is not so much a calling as a blessing — or a curse. For some eldrich scions, this arcane birthright manifests in subtle and carefully controlled ways, assisting in their manipulation of others or the pursuit of lofty goals. For others, it is wild and unpredictable, the primal and explosive lashing out of a power greater than themselves.
At 3rd level, and every two levels thereafter, an eldrich scion learns an additional spell, derived from her bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given at new levels. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.
At 7th level, and every six levels thereafter, an eldrich scion receives one bonus feat, chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The eldrich scion must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.	Každý eldrich scion má v rámci svého původu zdroj magie, který mu uděluje {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spells{/g}, bonusové {g|Encyclopedia:Feat}feats{/g}, dodatečnou třídní {g|Encyclopedia:Skills}skill{/g} a jiné {g|Encyclopedia:Special_Abilities}special abilities{/g}. Tento zdroj může představovat pokrevní vazbu nebo extrémní událost s tvorem v minulosti rodu. Například eldrich scion může mít draka jako vzdáleného příbuzného nebo jeho dědeček mohl podepsat hroznou smlouvu s ďáblem. Bez ohledu na původ se tento vliv projeví mnoha způsoby s růstem úrovní. Eldrich scion musí při získání první úrovně eldrich scion zvolit jeden rodokmen. Jakmile je volba učiněna, nelze ji změnit.	too_short:0.41

Hampered: All of the target's speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet).
These penalties don't stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends.

6313	At 1st level a spirit hunter can, as a {g|Encyclopedia:Swift_Action}swift action{/g}, grant a +1 enhancement {g|Encyclopedia:Bonus}bonus{/g} for 1 minute to any weapon she is holding. For every four levels beyond 1st, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +5 at 17th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon enhancement to a maximum of +5. Effects of multiple uses of this ability don't stack.
At 1st level, the bonus can be used to add {g|EnhancementGhostTouch}ghost touch{/g} special ability to the weapon.
At 5th level, these bonuses can be used to add any of the following weapon special abilities: {g|EnhancementFlaming}flaming{/g}, {g|EnhancementFrost}frost{/g}, {g|EnhancementKeen}keen{/g}, {g|EnhancementShocking}shock{/g}, or {g|EnhancementSpeed}speed{/g}.
Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's base price modifier. These special abilities are added to any the weapon already has, but duplicates don't stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other special abilities can be added. These bonuses and special abilities are decided when the ability is used and cannot be changed until the next time the spirit hunter uses this ability. These bonuses do not function if the weapon is wielded by anyone other than the spirit hunter.
A spirit hunter can only enhance one weapon at a time with this ability. If she uses this ability again, the first use immediately ends.
This ability can be used a number of times per day equal to half the spirit hunter level plus her {g|Encyclopedia:Wisdom}Wisdom{/g} modifier.

Her movement {g|Encyclopedia:Speed}speed{/g} is increased by 10 feet. She also gains one bite ({g|Encyclopedia:Dice}2d6{/g}), two claws (1d6), two secondary wing attacks (1d6) (secondary attacks do not benefit from shifter claws), and one tail slap attack (1d8). Her breath weapon and resistance depend on the type of her dragon prototype. She can only use the breath weapon once per 1d4 {g|Encyclopedia:Combat_Round}rounds{/g}. All breath weapons deal 8d8 points of {g|Encyclopedia:Damage}damage{/g} and allow a Reflex save for half damage.
This ability lasts for 1 hour (the Master Shapeshifter mythic ability makes this duration permanent). Using dragon shape is a {g|Encyclopedia:Standard_Actions}standard action{/g} that does not cause {g|Encyclopedia:Attack_Of_Opportunity}attacks of opportunity{/g}.

She can maintain this form for a number of minutes per day equal to 3 + her shifter level. The duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.
At 5th level, the fiendflesh shifter's DR increases to 2/good, and she also grows a pair of bat-like wings when in her fiendish aspect, granting her immunity to ground-based effects.
At 10th level, the fiendflesh shifter's DR increases to 5/good, and the electricity and fire {g|Encyclopedia:Energy_Resistance}resistance{/g} provided by her fiendish resilience ability doubles while she is in her fiendish aspect.

7073	Each sorcerer has a source of magic somewhere in her heritage that grants her {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spells{/g}, bonus {g|Encyclopedia:Feat}feats{/g}, an additional class {g|Encyclopedia:Skills}skill{/g}, and other {g|Encyclopedia:Special_Abilities}special abilities{/g}. This source can represent a blood relation or an extreme event involving a creature somewhere in the family's past. For example, a sorcerer might have a dragon as a distant relative or her grandfather might have signed a terrible contract with a devil. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways as the sorcerer gains levels. A sorcerer must pick one bloodline upon taking her first level of sorcerer. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.
Filled with magical power that screams for release, sorcery is not so much a calling as a blessing — or a curse. For some sorcerers, this arcane birthright manifests in subtle and carefully controlled ways, assisting in their manipulation of others or the pursuit of lofty goals. For others, it is wild and unpredictable, the primal and explosive lashing out of a power greater than themselves.
At 3rd level, and every two levels thereafter, a sorcerer learns an additional spell, derived from her bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given at new levels. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.
At 7th level, and every six levels thereafter, a sorcerer receives one bonus feat, chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The sorcerer must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.	Každý sorcerer má ve svém původu zdroj magie, který mu propůjčuje {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spells{/g}, bonusové {g|Encyclopedia:Feat}feats{/g}, další třídu {g|Encyclopedia:Skills}skill{/g} a jiné {g|Encyclopedia:Special_Abilities}special abilities{/g}. Tento zdroj může představovat krevní příbuzenství nebo extrémní událost zahrnující bytost v minulosti rodiny. Například sorcerer může mít draka jako vzdáleného příbuzného nebo jeho dědeček mohl podepsat hroznou smlouvu s ďáblem. Bez ohledu na původ se tento vliv s postupem úrovní projevuje řadou způsobů. Sorcerer si musí zvolit jednu bloodline při získání své první úrovně sorcerera. Jakmile je volba učiněna, nelze ji změnit.	too_short:0.43

Energy Absorption: At 6th level, you gain an amount of energy absorption equal to 3 times your wizard level per day. Whenever you take {g|Encyclopedia:Energy_Damage}energy damage{/g}, apply immunity, vulnerability (if any), and resistance first and apply the rest to this absorption, reducing your daily total by that amount. Any {g|Encyclopedia:Damage}damage{/g} in excess of your absorption is applied to you normally.

8443	At 1st level, the arcane bomber gains an ability nearly identical to the alchemist's bomb ability. Unlike the alchemist, at 1st level, the arcane bomber chooses one type of energy from the following list: acid, cold, fire, and electricity. He can throw bombs of that type, but cannot modify them with discoveries. An arcane bomber can use a number of bombs each day equal to his {g|Encyclopedia:Class_Level}class level{/g} + his {g|Encyclopedia:Intelligence}Intelligence{/g} modifier.
Thrown bombs have a range of 30 feet and use the Throw Splash Weapon special {g|Encyclopedia:Attack}attack{/g}. Bombs are considered weapons and can be selected using {g|Encyclopedia:Feat}feats{/g} such as Point-Blank Shot and Weapon Focus. On a direct hit, an arcane bomber's bomb inflicts {g|Encyclopedia:Dice}1d6{/g} points of {g|Encyclopedia:Damage}damage{/g} of the chosen energy type + additional damage equal to the arcane bomber's Intelligence modifier. The damage of an arcane bomber's bomb increases by 1d6 points at every odd-numbered arcane bomber level. Splash damage from an arcane bomber's bomb is always equal to the bomb's minimum damage (so if the bomb would deal 2d6+4 points of damage of the chosen energy type on a direct hit, its splash damage would be 6 points of damage of chosen energy type). Those caught in the splash damage can attempt a {g|Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw}Reflex save{/g} for half damage. The {g|Encyclopedia:DC}DC{/g} of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcane bomber's level + the arcane bomber's Intelligence modifier.	Na 1. úrovni získává mystický bombardér schopnost téměř totožnou s alchymistovou schopností bomby. Na rozdíl od alchymisty si však mystický bombardér na 1. úrovni zvolí jeden typ energie z následujícího seznamu: acid, cold, fire, a electricity. Může házet bomby toho typu, ale nemůže je upravovat pomocí discoveries. Mystický bombardér může používat počet bomb za den roven jeho {g|Encyclopedia:Class_Level}class level{/g} + jeho {g|Encyclopedia:Intelligence}Intelligence{/g} modifikátoru.	too_short:0.32

8518	Benefits: A Thassilonian specialist wizard receives two additional {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g} slots of each spell level he can cast. These bonus spell slots must both be used to prepare the same spell from the wizard's school of specialization, allowing the wizard to cast that spell twice. The wizard cannot use these slots to prepare two different spells, even if they are of the school he is specialized in.
Restrictions: A Thassilonian specialist does not get to customize his choice for opposition schools — that choice is selected for him when he chooses his specialization. These restrictions are more significant than those most wizards follow, and are known as prohibited schools. A Thassilonian wizard can never prepare a spell that is in one of his prohibited schools — he treats these spells as if they were not on the wizard spell list. If using a spell trigger or spell completion item to cast a spell from one of his prohibited schools, he must use the {g|Encyclopedia:Use_Magic_Device}Use Magic Device{/g} {g|Encyclopedia:Skills}skill{/g} to do so.	Výhody: Thassilonian specialist wizard získává dvě dodatečné {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g} sloty každé úrovně kouzla, které může sesílat. Tyto bonusové sloty musí být oba použity k připravení téhož kouzla ze školy specializace kouzelníka, což kouzelníkovi umožní seslat toto kouzlo dvakrát. Kouzelník nemůže tyto sloty použít k připravení dvou rozdílných kouzel, ani kdyby obě patřila do školy, ve které se specializuje.	too_short:0.39

9922	This standalone DLC concludes the story that began in Through the Ashes. After completing it, the Knight Commander will find a deadly new trial awaits them in chapter 5 of the main campaign.
Through the Ashes ended with our heroes on the cusp of the Abyss, where the fallen demon lord Sithhud — master of ice and bones — was about to rise again. Our ragtag group of Kenabres survivors are the only ones who can stop him. Learn the secrets of the forgotten demon lord, collect his cursed treasure, and pave the way for new triumphs on the part of the Knight Commander.

9988	Any armor heavier than leather, as well as any shield, hurts a character's ability to use {g|Encyclopedia:Dexterity}Dexterity{/g} and {g|Encyclopedia:Strength}Strength{/g}-based {g|Encyclopedia:Skills}skills{/g}. {g|Encyclopedia:Penalty}Penalties{/g} from armor and a shield stack.
For example, a character wears a full plate armor and tries to move a heavy boulder ({g|Encyclopedia:Athletics}Athletics{/g} skill {g|Encyclopedia:Check}check{/g}). It means that this check will get a –6 penalty to the final result, making it way harder.
A character's encumbrance may also incur a penalty. Medium encumbrance adds a –3 penalty to skill checks, and Heavy encumbrance adds a –6 penalty.	Jakékoliv brnění těžší než kožené, stejně jako jakýkoliv štít, snižuje postavě schopnost používat {g|Encyclopedia:Dexterity}Dexterity{/g} a {g|Encyclopedia:Strength}Strength{/g}-založené {g|Encyclopedia:Skills}skills{/g}. {g|Encyclopedia:Penalty}Penalties{/g} z brnění a ze štítu se sčítají.	too_short:0.43

9993	An attack roll is an attempt to strike your opponent.
Your attack roll result is calculated by the following formula:
{g|Encyclopedia:Dice}d20{/g} + {g|Encyclopedia:BAB}Base Attack Bonus{/g} + {g|Encyclopedia:Ability_Scores}ability score{/g} modifier (usually {g|Encyclopedia:Strength}Strength{/g} for {g|Encyclopedia:MeleeAttack}melee attacks{/g}, {g|Encyclopedia:Dexterity}Dexterity{/g} for {g|Encyclopedia:RangedAttack}ranged attacks{/g}) + other modifiers.
If your result equals or higher than the target's {g|Encyclopedia:Armor_Class}Armor Class{/g}, you've scored a hit and you will deal {g|Encyclopedia:Damage}damage{/g}.
A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on an attack roll is always a miss. A natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a hit. A natural 20 is also a critical threat — it means a {g|Encyclopedia:Critical}critical{/g} hit is possible.	Hod na útok je pokus zasáhnout protivníka.	too_short:0.05
9995	Attacks of opportunity (AoO) are special {g|Encyclopedia:MeleeAttack}melee attacks{/g}. A character can perform them during an enemy's turn if that enemy provokes it while being in their threatened area, creating an opening for a hit. The number of such attacks a creature can make per {g|Encyclopedia:Combat_Round}round{/g} is limited — usually a creature can't perform it more than once, even if it's provoked again during the same turn.
Following {g|Encyclopedia:CA_Types}actions{/g} provoke AoO when an enemy attempts them while standing in a {g|Encyclopedia:Threatened_Area}threatened area{/g}:
* Attempt to leave melee
* {g|Encyclopedia:RangedAttack}Ranged attack{/g}
* Attempt to stand up from being {g|ConditionProne}prone{/g}
* Casting a {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g}
* Drinking a potion
In most cases, an AoO can be avoided. Characters leaving melee can use a {g|Encyclopedia:Special_Abilities}special ability{/g} to make a {g|Encyclopedia:Mobility}Mobility{/g} {g|Encyclopedia:Skills}skill{/g} {g|Encyclopedia:Check}check{/g} and attempt doing it without provoking an {g|Encyclopedia:Attack}attack{/g}. In turn-based mode character can use a 5-foot step to leave melee without provoking an attack. Spellcasters, when they cast in melee, automatically make an attempt to cast defensively.	Útoky příležitosti (AoO) jsou speciální {g|Encyclopedia:MeleeAttack}melee attacks{/g}. Postava je může provést během tahu nepřítele, pokud ji tento nepřítel vyprovokuje, zatímco se nachází v jeho ohrožené oblasti, čímž vznikne příležitost k zásahu. Počet takových útoků, které tvor může provést za {g|Encyclopedia:Combat_Round}round{/g}, je omezen — obvykle tvor nemůže provést více než jeden útok, i když je během téhož tahu znovu vyprovokován.	too_short:0.34

10015	<b>Movement During a Charge</b>
You must move before your {g|Encyclopedia:Attack}attack{/g}, not after. You must move at least 10 feet and may move up to double your {g|Encyclopedia:Speed}speed{/g} directly toward the designated opponent. If you move a distance equal to your speed or less, you can also draw a weapon during a charge attack if your {g|Encyclopedia:BAB}base attack bonus{/g} is at least +1.
You must have a clear path toward the opponent, and nothing can hinder your movement (such as difficult terrain or obstacles). You must move to the closest space from which you can attack the opponent. If this space is occupied or otherwise blocked, you can't charge. If any line from your starting space to the ending space passes through an area that blocks movement, slows movement, or contains a creature (even an ally), you can't charge. {g|Encyclopedia:Helpless}Helpless{/g} creatures don't stop a charge.
If you don't have a line of sight to the opponent at the start of your turn, you can't charge that opponent.
If you are able to take only a {g|Encyclopedia:Standard_Actions}standard action{/g} on your turn, you can still charge, but you are only allowed to move up to your speed (instead of up to double your speed) and you cannot draw a weapon unless you possess the Quick Draw {g|Encyclopedia:Feat}feat{/g}. You can't use this option unless you are restricted to taking only a standard action on your turn.	<b>Pohyb během nabíjení</b>	too_short:0.02
10016	<b>{g|Encyclopedia:Attack}Attacking{/g} on a Charge</b>
After moving, you may make a single {g|Encyclopedia:MeleeAttack}melee attack{/g}. You get a +2 {g|Encyclopedia:Bonus}bonus{/g} on the attack roll and take a –2 {g|Encyclopedia:Penalty}penalty{/g} to your {g|Encyclopedia:Armor_Class}AC{/g} until the start of your next turn.
A charging character gets a +2 bonus on {g|Encyclopedia:Combat_Maneuvers}combat maneuver{/g} attack rolls made to bull rush an opponent.
Even if you have extra attacks, such as from having a high enough {g|Encyclopedia:BAB}Base Attack Bonus (BAB){/g} or from using multiple weapons, you only get to make one attack during a charge.	<b>{g|Encyclopedia:Attack}Attacking{/g} on a Charge</b>	too_short:0.08
10019	Charisma measures a character's power of personality, personal magnetism, ability to lead, and appearance.
Here are examples where you apply your character's Charisma modifier:
• {g|Encyclopedia:Persuasion}Persuasion{/g} and {g|Encyclopedia:Use_Magic_Device}Use Magic Device{/g} {g|Encyclopedia:Skills}skill{/g} {g|Encyclopedia:Check}checks{/g}.
• Channel energy {g|Encyclopedia:DC}DCs{/g} for clerics and paladins attempting to harm undead foes.
Bards, paladins, bloodragers, oracles, skalds, and sorcerers gain a number of bonus {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spells{/g} based on their Charisma scores. The minimum Charisma score needed to cast their spell is 10 + the spell's level.	Charisma vyjadřuje sílu osobnosti postavy, osobní magnetismus, schopnost vést a vzhled.	too_short:0.13

10088	If your {g|Encyclopedia:Attack}attack{/g} succeeds, you deal the target some damage. Damage calculation is a dice {g|Encyclopedia:Dice}roll{/g} with {g|Encyclopedia:Bonus}bonuses{/g} and {g|Encyclopedia:Penalty}penalties{/g} depending on weapon you use to attack and different factors. Damage reduces the target's current {g|Encyclopedia:HP}hit points{/g}.
<b>Minimum Damage</b>
If attacker's penalties reduce the damage result to less than 1, a hit still deals 1 point of damage. This damage still can be reduced by enemy abilities like {g|Encyclopedia:Damage_Reduction}Damage Reduction{/g} or Energy {g|Encyclopedia:Energy_Resistance}Resistance{/g}.
<b>{g|Encyclopedia:Strength}Strength{/g} Bonus</b>
When you hit with a melee or thrown weapon, add your Strength modifier to the damage result.
When you deal damage with a weapon in your off hand, you add only half your Strength bonus. If you have a Strength penalty, the entire penalty applies.
When you deal damage with a weapon that you are wielding {g|Encyclopedia:Light_Weapon}two-handed{/g}, you add 1.5 times your Strength bonus (Strength penalties are not multiplied). You don't get this higher Strength bonus, however, when using a light weapon with two hands.
<b>Type of Damage</b>
There are two main types of damage: {g|Encyclopedia:Energy_Damage}energy damage{/g} and {g|Encyclopedia:Physical_Damage}physical damage{/g}.	Pokud váš {g|Encyclopedia:Attack}attack{/g} uspěje, způsobíte cíli určité {g|Encyclopedia:Damage}damage{/g}.

10089	<b>Overcoming DR</b>
Damage reduction could be overcome by using weapons made from special materials (like Cold Iron or Adamantine), magic weapons (any weapon with a +1 or higher enhancement {g|Encyclopedia:Bonus}bonus{/g}, excluding masterwork), certain types of weapons (such as {g|Encyclopedia:Damage_Type}slashing or bludgeoning{/g}), and weapons imbued with an {g|Encyclopedia:Alignment}alignment{/g} (like good-aligned).
Weapons with an enhancement bonus of +3 or greater can ignore some types of damage reduction, regardless of their actual material or alignment.

<b>Natural Healing</b>
With a full night's {g|Encyclopedia:Rest}rest{/g} (8 hours of sleep or more), you recover 1 hit point per {g|Encyclopedia:Character_Level}character level{/g}.
<b>Magical Healing</b>
Various abilities and {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spells{/g} can restore hit points, like {g|SpellsCureLightWounds}cure light wounds{/g}, {g|SpellsHeal}heal{/g}, or lay on hands.
<b>Healing Ability Damage</b>
Temporary {g|Encyclopedia:AbilityDamage}ability damage{/g} returns at the rate of 1 point per night of rest (8 hours) for each affected {g|Encyclopedia:Ability_Scores}ability score{/g}.

10176	Each character has a certain number of {g|Encyclopedia:HP}hit points{/g} (HP). Depending on which game difficulty you've chosen the rules will vary.
If you chose the Story Mode, your characters never die. When their HP value drops to 0, they lose consciousness. After the combat is over, the character will get up and can be controlled again. You only lose the game if your whole party is {g|Encyclopedia:Injury_Death}unconscious{/g}.
If you chose the Easy Mode, when a character's HP value drops to 0, they lose consciousness. After the combat is over, the character will get up and can be controlled again. A character's HP value can drop into negative numbers without killing them. However, if a character is reduced to a negative amount of hit points equal to their {g|Encyclopedia:Constitution}Constitution{/g} score, they die. To resurrect them, you will need a special {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g}.
If you chose the Normal Mode, a character will not die after suffering a deadly injury for the first time. Instead, Death's Door condition will afflict them. If a character with this condition suffers a deadly injury again, they will die. The game will be over if all party members suffer deadly injuries.
If you chose the Challenging Mode or higher, your characters will die after suffering a deadly injury. If your main character dies, the game is over.
To restore the lost hit points, you can use {g|Encyclopedia:Healing}healing{/g} spells, potions, or {g|Encyclopedia:Rest}rest{/g}. Healing potions can be bought from merchants or obtained as trophies after combat. Healing spells are accessible to the following classes: bard, druid, cleric, inquisitor, and paladin.
To use expendable items, such as scrolls, potions, and wands, open your inventory and place them into a quick slot.	Každá postava má určité množství {g|Encyclopedia:HP}hit points{/g} (HP). Pravidla se liší podle vybrané obtížnosti hry.	too_short:0.07

10197	<b>Effects of Hit Point Damage</b>
If a character's current number of hit points is 0 or negative, but the number of negative HP is less than its {g|Encyclopedia:Constitution}Constitution{/g} score, it is unconscious.
When your negative hit point total becomes equal to your Constitution score, you're dead. Characters never die on Story Mode.
<b>Unconscious</b>
Unconscious is one of the {g|Encyclopedia:Helpless}Helpless{/g} conditions when you can take no {g|Encyclopedia:CA_Types}actions{/g}. After a battle, unconscious characters {g|Encyclopedia:Healing}heal{/g} some {g|Encyclopedia:HP}hit points{/g}, gain consciousness and stand up.
<b>Death Door</b>
When character dies for the first time, he revives after the battle, but gains "at death door" effect. Next time such character will die for real and will have to be revived. This happens only on Daring or lower difficulty or if special option is turned on.
<b>Dead</b>
Dead characters can be revived with some {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spells{/g} or scrolls like {g|SpellsRaiseDead}raise dead{/g} or {g|SpellsResurrection}resurrection{/g}. If you don't have a character who can cast the required spell, you can find an NPC in a safe place, i.e. {g|Encyclopedia:Rest}camp{/g} or city, who will cast it for you.	<b>Důsledky poškození HP</b>	too_short:0.02
10202	Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons. Animal companions require Intelligence score 3 to gain access to many new {g|Encyclopedia:Feat}feats{/g}.
Here are examples where you apply your character's Intelligence modifier:
• The number of {g|Encyclopedia:Skills}skill{/g} points gained each level, though your character always gets at least 1 skill point per level.
• {g|Encyclopedia:Knowledge_Arcana}Knowledge (arcana){/g} and {g|Encyclopedia:Knowledge_World}Knowledge (world){/g} {g|Encyclopedia:Check}checks{/g}.
Alchemists, arcanists, witches, magi and wizards gain bonus {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spells{/g} based on their Intelligence score. The minimum Intelligence score needed to cast their spells is 10 + the spell's level.	Intelligence určuje, jak dobře se tvá postava učí a uvažuje.

10217	Weapon Class is a measure of how much effort it takes to wield a weapon in combat.
<b>Light Weapons</b>
A light weapon is used in one hand and is easier to use in one's off hand than a one-handed weapon. For primary hand {g|Encyclopedia:MeleeAttack}melee attacks{/g} the wielder's {g|Encyclopedia:Strength}Strength{/g} modifier is added to {g|Encyclopedia:Damage}damage{/g} rolls, or half of the wielder's Strength {g|Encyclopedia:Bonus}bonus{/g} for the off hand {g|Encyclopedia:Attack}attacks{/g}. When using both hands to wield a light weapon the Strength bonus applies as though the weapon were held in the wielder's primary hand only.
An {g|Encyclopedia:UnarmedAttack}unarmed strike{/g} is always considered a light weapon.
<b>One-Handed Weapons</b>
A one-handed weapon can be used in either the primary hand or the off hand. For primary hand melee attacks the wielder's Strength modifier is added to damage rolls, or half of the wielder's Strength bonus for the off hand attacks. If a one-handed weapon is wielded with two hands during melee combat, 1.5 times the character's Strength bonus is added to damage rolls.
<b>Two-Handed Weapons</b>
Two hands are required to use a two-handed melee weapon effectively. For melee attacks with such a weapon 1.5 times the character's Strength bonus is applied to damage rolls.	Třída zbraně je míra, kolik úsilí stojí ovládat zbraň v boji.	too_short:0.05

10257	Natural attacks are {g|Encyclopedia:Attack}attacks{/g} made with natural weapons, such as claws, bites or wings. Creature doesn't receive additional natural attacks for a high {g|Encyclopedia:BAB}base attack bonus{/g}, but can gain additional attacks from various effects like the {g|SpellsHaste}haste{/g} spell. Creatures like animal companions can have one or more natural attacks, and are able to gain additional attacks (depending on available limbs) with level progression.
There are two main types of natural attacks: primary, such as claws or bites, and secondary, such as hoofs or wings.
Primary natural attacks add {g|Encyclopedia:Strength}Strength{/g} modifier to the {g|Encyclopedia:Damage}damage{/g} dealt. If it's the only attack of a creature, it adds 1.5×Strength modifier to the damage dealt.
Secondary natural attacks have a –5 {g|Encyclopedia:Penalty}penalty{/g} to attack rolls and add half the Strength modifier to the damage dealt.
In case a creature has weapon attacks and natural attacks, weapon attacks always go first and work normally (with additional attacks for base attack bonus), and all natural attacks will always work as secondary natural attacks. A limb that holds a weapon can't be used to perform a natural attack.	Natural attacks jsou útoky prováděné přirozenými zbraněmi, jako drápy, kousnutí nebo křídla. Tvor nezískává další natural attacks kvůli vysokému {g|Encyclopedia:BAB}base attack bonus{/g}, ale může získat další útoky z různých efektů, jako je kouzlo {g|SpellsHaste}haste{/g}.

Your saving throw is:

These saves test your ability to dodge area attacks and unexpected situations. Apply your {g|Encyclopedia:Dexterity}Dexterity{/g} modifier to your Reflex saving throws.

Size modifiers of different kinds apply to {g|Encyclopedia:Armor_Class}armor class{/g}, {g|Encyclopedia:Attack}attack{/g} rolls, {g|Encyclopedia:Stealth}Stealth{/g} {g|Encyclopedia:Check}checks{/g}, {g|Encyclopedia:Combat_Maneuvers}combat maneuver{/g} checks, and various other checks.
Size modifier for a creature's AC and attack rolls is as follows:

The special size modifier for a creature's {g|Encyclopedia:CMB}Combat Maneuver Bonus{/g} is as follows:

Determine the number of skill ranks your character gets based on his class and {g|Encyclopedia:Intelligence}Intelligence{/g} modifier (and any other {g|Encyclopedia:Bonus}bonuses{/g}, such as the bonus received by humans). Then allocate these ranks to desired skills, but remember that you cannot have more ranks than your level in any one skill (for a starting character, this is usually one).
Each level thereafter, your character gains a number of skill ranks dependent upon your class plus your Intelligence modifier. Investing a rank in a skill represents a measure of training in that skill.	{g|Encyclopedia:Skills}Skill{/g} představuje schopnost tvora vykonat běžný úkol, jako vylézt po zdi, plížit se chodbou nebo zpozorovat vetřelce.

In order to determine success, whenever you attempt to use a skill, you must make a skill check. If the result of your skill check is equal to or greater than the {g|Encyclopedia:DC}difficulty class{/g} (or DC) of the task you are attempting to accomplish, you succeed.
Skill check can be calculated with the following formula:
{g|Encyclopedia:Dice}1d20{/g} + skill ranks + ability modifier + racial modifier + class skill modifier.
Some skill checks cannot be performed if your character has not put at least one rank into it.

"One by one. Step by step. I follow in your foosteps, Master, bound for the wealth and glory you have promised me. When I entered your flock, I left behind poverty and sorrow. I will never forget the stench of the village hut where I was born, for the memory of it is a reminder never to return. When I joined the faith, I learned the true purpose of mortal life — the accumulation of wealth. I hunger for gold, influence, and glory, and I desire to follow your path to greatness. I am guided by your precepts. Just as you endured thirty-one trials before you attained godhood, so I will overcome every obstacle that stands in my way. No difficulty will deter me, no adversity will stop me, for only in the service of our Lord will I find a life of plenty and comfort.
Oh Lord, multiply my wealth and bestow the bounty of your favor upon me. Razmir, may you bless your servant with prosperity and peace."

Fools see in the law a beacon of safety and certainty. 'Heed these rules, and the powers that be shall protect you,' society tells them. Leave them be. They are as they should be: malleable, complacent, content to obey authority.
For what is the law if not the derivative of power? It is the instrument through which power constrains and directs the masses. Nothing more than that. Power established the laws, and power may change them. Yet such changes must not be made wantonly lest Hell should become like the Abyss with its chaos based on the rule of the strong. Such changes must be disguised in ways palatable to the masses and used openly only in cases of dire need.
While commoners are content to obey the law, elites are subject to power itself. For it is power that can shatter the foundations of any regime and erect them anew. Never forget this."	"Zákon je nedotknutelný. Avšak moc jest prvotní.	too_short:0.05

In addition, the edges of the pit are sloped, and any creature ending its turn in a space adjacent to the pit must make a Reflex saving throw with a +2 {g|Encyclopedia:Bonus}bonus{/g} to avoid falling into it.

16824	Gnomes trace their lineage back to the mysterious realm of the fey, a place where colors are brighter, the wildlands wilder, and emotions more primal. Unknown forces drove the ancient gnomes from that realm long ago, forcing them to seek refuge in this world; despite this, the gnomes have never completely abandoned their fey roots or adapted to mortal culture. As a result, gnomes are widely regarded by the other races as alien and strange.
Gnomes are one of the smallest of the common races, generally standing just over 3 feet in height. Their hair tends toward vibrant colors such as the fiery orange of autumn leaves, the verdant green of forests at springtime, or the deep reds and purples of wild flowers in bloom. Similarly, their flesh tones range from earthy browns to floral pinks, frequently with little regard for heredity. Gnomes possess highly mutable facial characteristics, and many have overly large mouths and eyes, an effect which can be both disturbing and stunning, depending on the individual.	Gnomové hledají svůj původ v tajemném říši fey, místě s jasnějšími barvami, divočejší přírodou a primárnějšími emocemi. Neznámé síly kdysi dávno vyhnaly starobylé gnomy z oné říše a donutily je hledat útočiště v našem světě; přesto gnomové nikdy zcela neopustili své fey kořeny ani se nestali zcela mortálními. V důsledku toho jsou gnomové ostatními rasami považováni za cizí a podivné.	too_short:0.38

16834	Androids are superficially identical to humans in many ways, and to the uninformed it can be difficult to differentiate the two. In the right light, though, androids' alien nature is revealed by the metallic sheen in their eyes and the biological, tattoo-like circuitry that riddles their skin. Their bodies are completely artificial, though made of materials that mimic the flexibility, shape, and density of human flesh and bone. Their organs mirror those of humans so well that only by examining the materials and makeup of these systems — which use sheeny oils and polymer alloys rather than blood and marrow — could one guess that their physiology is alien. Androids are roughly the same size as humans; on average, they are 6 feet tall and weigh 200 pounds.
Kellid shamans speak of great forges where androids are "born" from metal wombs and are cut from electrified umbilical cords. Even androids can't refute or verify such stories, since most who emerge from Numerian ruins do so naked and without any memories beyond their initial egress into the wide, unfamiliar world. Their complex design is unlike that of any race known to Golarion's solar system, leading many to suspect that they (and the alien spaceship on which they crashed onto Golarion) originated from a distant star system or even another galaxy.
What separates androids from golems and other mindless constructs is that androids are living beings and as such possess souls. Similarly, androids don't live forever, though barring violence or tragedy their bodies never deteriorate. Rather, an android's cybernetic mind eventually shuts down and self-restarts after about a century, leaving its body vacant for several weeks as the old soul departs for its final reward in the Great Beyond and a fresh, new soul finds its way into the shell.	Androidi jsou zvenčí povrchně podobní lidem v mnoha ohledech, a nezkušenému pozorovateli může být těžké je odlišit. Ve správném světle se však jejich cizí povaha prozradí kovovým leskem v očích a biologickými, tetováním připomínajícími obvody rozesetými po kůži. Jejich těla jsou zcela umělá, avšak z materiálů napodobujících pružnost, tvar a hustotu lidské tkáně a kostí. Jejich orgány tak věrně napodobují lidské, že jediným způsobem, jak odhalit, že jejich fyziologie je cizí, je zkoumání materiálů a složení těchto systémů — používají lesklé oleje a polymerové slitiny místo krve a dřeně. Androidi jsou přibližně stejně velcí jako lidé; průměrně měří 6 stop a váží 200 liber.	too_short:0.37

21505	Charging is a special {g|Encyclopedia:CA_Types}action{/g} that allows you to move up to double your normal {g|Encyclopedia:Speed}speed{/g} and {g|Encyclopedia:Attack}attack{/g} during the same action.
You must move before your attack, not after. You must move at least 10 feet, directly toward the designated opponent.
You must have a clear path toward the opponent.
After moving, you may make a single {g|Encyclopedia:MeleeAttack}melee attack{/g}. You get a +2 {g|Encyclopedia:Bonus}bonus{/g} on the attack roll and take a –2 {g|Encyclopedia:Penalty}penalty{/g} to your {g|Encyclopedia:Armor_Class}AC{/g} until the beginning of your next turn.	Nápor je speciální {g|Encyclopedia:CA_Types}akce{/g}, která ti umožňuje pohnout se až do dvojnásobku tvé normální {g|Encyclopedia:Speed}rychlosti{/g} a {g|Encyclopedia:Attack}útočit{/g} během téže akce.	too_short:0.31
21506	As a {g|Encyclopedia:Full_Round_Action}full-round action{/g}, you can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace to a {g|Encyclopedia:Helpless}helpless{/g} opponent.
You automatically hit and score a {g|Encyclopedia:Critical}critical hit{/g}. If the defender survives the {g|Encyclopedia:Damage}damage{/g}, they must make a {g|Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw}Fortitude save{/g} ({g|Encyclopedia:DC}DC{/g} 10 + attacker's {g|Encyclopedia:BAB}base attack bonus{/g} + melee damage ability modifier + weapon's critical multiplier) or die.
Delivering a coup de grace provokes {g|Encyclopedia:Attack_Of_Opportunity}attacks of opportunity{/g} from {g|Encyclopedia:Threatened_Area}threatening{/g} opponents.
You can't deliver a coup de grace against a creature that is immune to critical hits.	Jako {g|Encyclopedia:Full_Round_Action}full-round action{/g} můžeš použít melee zbraň k vykonání smrtícího úderu na {g|Encyclopedia:Helpless}helpless{/g} protivníka.	too_short:0.21

21976	You give the subject a single command, which it obeys to the best of its ability at its earliest opportunity. You may select from the following options.
Approach: On its turn, the subject moves toward you as quickly and directly as possible for 1 {g|Encyclopedia:Combat_Round}round{/g}. The creature may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes {g|Encyclopedia:Attack_Of_Opportunity}attacks of opportunity{/g} for this movement as normal.
Fall: On its turn, the subject falls to the ground and remains {g|ConditionProne}prone{/g} for 1 round. It may act normally while prone but takes any appropriate {g|Encyclopedia:Penalty}penalties{/g}.
Flee: On its turn, the subject moves away from you as quickly as possible for 1 round. It may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.
Halt: The subject stands in place for 1 round. It may not take any {g|Encyclopedia:CA_Types}actions{/g} but is not considered {g|Encyclopedia:Helpless}helpless{/g}.
If the subject can't carry out your command on its next turn, the {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g} automatically fails.	Dáš subjektu jediné rozkázání, které podle svých nejlepších schopností vykoná při první příležitosti. Můžeš vybrat z následujících možností.	too_short:0.12
21988	You gain some of the beneficial qualities of an animal. Your base form is largely unchanged and your {g|Encyclopedia:Size}size{/g} is unaltered, but some of your body parts are altered. Armor or gear you are wearing adjusts to your new shape for the duration of the {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g}. When you cast animal aspect, choose one of the following animals to gain the associated benefits. You can only have one animal aspect or {g|SpellsGreaterAnimalAspect}animal aspect, greater{/g} spell active on you at a time.
Gorilla: Your arms become long, flexible, and strong like those of a great ape. You gain a +4 competence {g|Encyclopedia:Bonus}bonus{/g} to {g|Encyclopedia:CMB}CMB{/g}.
Monkey: Your hands and arms become dexterous like those of a simian. You gain a +4 competence bonus on {g|Encyclopedia:Athletics}Athletics{/g} {g|Encyclopedia:Check}checks{/g}, and you can throw objects as if you had the Throw Anything {g|Encyclopedia:Feat}feat{/g}.
Raccoon: Your hands become extremely dexterous, and your feet become padded. You gain a +2 competence bonus on {g|Encyclopedia:Trickery}Trickery{/g} and {g|Encyclopedia:Stealth}Stealth{/g} checks.
Raptor: Your legs become built for running {g|Encyclopedia:Speed}speed{/g}, like those of a deinonychus. You gain a enhancement bonus of +20 feet to your base speed.	Získáš některé blahodárné vlastnosti zvířete. Tvá základní podoba zůstává z většiny nezměněna a tvoje {g|Encyclopedia:Size}size{/g} se nemění, ale některé části těla jsou pozměněny. Zbroj nebo výbava, kterou nosíš, se na dobu trvání {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g} přizpůsobí tvému novému tvaru.

Můžeš mít současně aktivní pouze jeden animal aspect nebo {g|SpellsGreaterAnimalAspect}animal aspect, greater{/g}.	too_short:0.38
22252	You touch an object when you cast this {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g}, causing the object to shed bright light in a 60-foot radius. This illumination increases the light level for an additional 60 feet by one step (darkness becomes dim light, dim light becomes normal light, and normal light becomes bright light). Creatures that take {g|Encyclopedia:Penalty}penalties{/g} in bright light take them while within the 60-foot radius of this magical light. Despite its name, this spell is not the equivalent of daylight for the purposes of creatures that are {g|Encyclopedia:Damage}damaged{/g} or destroyed by such light.	Při seslání tohoto {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g} se dotkneš předmětu, který začne vydávat jasné světlo v poloměru 60 stop. Toto osvětlení zvýší úroveň světla o jeden stupeň na dalších 60 stop (tma → slabé světlo, slabé světlo → normální světlo, normální → jasné). Stvoření, která v jasném světle dostávají {g|Encyclopedia:Penalty}penalties{/g}, je dostávají i v 60stopovém poloměru tohoto magického světla. Navzdory jménu tento {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g} není ekvivalentem daylight pro účely tvorů, kteří jsou {g|Encyclopedia:Damage}damaged{/g} nebo zničeni takovým světlem.	bilingual_arrow

22495	You point your finger and fire a black ray of negative energy that suppresses the life force of any living creature it strikes. You must make a ranged {g|Encyclopedia:TouchAttack}touch attack{/g} to hit. If you hit, the subject gains {g|Encyclopedia:Dice}1d4{/g} temporary negative levels.
Negative levels stack. Assuming the subject survives, it regains lost levels after a number of hours equal to your {g|Encyclopedia:Caster_Level}caster level{/g} (maximum 15 hours). Usually, negative levels have a chance of becoming permanent, but the negative levels from enervation don't last long enough to do so.
An undead creature struck by the ray gains 1d4 × 5 {g|Encyclopedia:Temporary_HP}temporary hit points{/g} for 1 hour.	Ukážeš prstem a vystřelíš černý paprsek negativní energie, jež potlačuje životní sílu každé živé bytosti, kterou zasáhne. Musíš provést vzdálený {g|Encyclopedia:TouchAttack}touch attack{/g}, abys zasáhl. Pokud zasáhneš, subjekt získá {g|Encyclopedia:Dice}1d4{/g} dočasných negativních úrovní.	too_short:0.40
22510	You draw down holy power to smite your enemies. Only {g|Encyclopedia:Alignment}evil and neutral{/g} creatures are harmed by the {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g}; good creatures are unaffected.
The spell deals {g|Encyclopedia:Dice}1d8{/g} points of {g|Encyclopedia:Damage}damage{/g} per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to each evil creature in the area (or 1d6 points of damage per {g|Encyclopedia:Caster_Level}caster level{/g}, maximum 10d6, to an evil outsider) and causes it to become {g|ConditionBlind}blinded{/g} for 1 {g|Encyclopedia:Combat_Round}round{/g}. A successful {g|Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw}Will saving throw{/g} reduces damage to half and negates the blinded effect.
The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither good nor evil, and they are not blinded. Such a creature can reduce that damage by half (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful Will save.	Přivoláš posvěcenou moc, abys srazil své nepřátele. Pouze {g|Encyclopedia:Alignment}evil and neutral{/g} stvoření jsou {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g}em poškozena; dobrá stvoření jsou nedotčena.	too_short:0.22
22530	You channel lawful power to smite enemies. The power takes the form of a three-dimensional grid of energy. Only {g|Encyclopedia:Alignment}chaotic and neutral{/g} (not lawful) creatures are harmed by the {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g}.
The spell deals {g|Encyclopedia:Dice}1d8{/g} points of {g|Encyclopedia:Damage}damage{/g} per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to chaotic creatures (or 1d6 points of damage per {g|Encyclopedia:Caster_Level}caster level{/g}, maximum 10d6, to chaotic outsiders) and causes them to be {g|ConditionDaze}dazed{/g} for 1 {g|Encyclopedia:Combat_Round}round{/g}. A successful {g|Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw}Will save{/g} reduces the damage to half and negates the daze effect.
The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither chaotic nor lawful, and they are not dazed. They can reduce the damage in half again (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful Will save.	Kanaluješ zákonnou moc, abys ztrestal nepřátele. Moc se projeví jako trojrozměrná mříž energie.

22553	You use material from the Plane of Shadow to shape quasi-real illusions of one or more creatures, objects, or forces. Shadow conjuration can mimic any sorcerer or wizard conjuration (summoning) or conjuration (creation) {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g} of 3rd level or lower. Shadow conjurations are only one-fifth (20%) as strong as the real things, though creatures who believe the shadow conjurations to be real are affected by them at full strength. Any creature that interacts with the spell can make a {g|Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw}Will save{/g} to recognize its true nature.
Spells that deal {g|Encyclopedia:Damage}damage{/g} have normal effects unless the affected creature succeeds on a Will save. Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth (20%) damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is only 20% likely to occur. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save that the spell being simulated allows, but the save {g|Encyclopedia:DC}DC{/g} is set according to shadow conjuration's level (4th) rather than the spell's normal level. In addition, any effect created by shadow conjuration allows {g|Encyclopedia:Spell_Resistance}spell resistance{/g}, even if the spell it is simulating does not. Shadow objects or substances have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them. Against disbelievers, they are 20% likely to work.
A shadow creature has one-fifth the {g|Encyclopedia:HP}hit points{/g} of a normal creature of its kind (regardless of whether it's recognized as shadowy). It deals normal damage and has all normal abilities and weaknesses. Against a creature that recognizes it as a shadow creature, however, the shadow creature's damage is one-fifth (20%) normal, and all {g|Encyclopedia:Special_Abilities}special abilities{/g} that do not deal lethal damage are only 20% likely to work. ({g|Encyclopedia:Dice}Roll{/g} for each use and each affected character separately.) Furthermore, the shadow creature's {g|Encyclopedia:Armor_Class}AC{/g} {g|Encyclopedia:Bonus}bonuses{/g} are just one-fifth as large. A creature that succeeds on its save sees the shadow conjurations as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms. Objects automatically succeed on their Will saves against this spell.	Využiješ látku z Plane of Shadow k utváření kvazi-reálných iluzí jednoho či více stvoření, předmětů či sil.

Shadow conjurations jsou však pouze jedné pětiny (20%) síly skutečných věcí, přesto však stvoření, která považují shadow conjurations za skutečné, jsou jimi postižena plnou silou.

Unlike other spells that {g|Encyclopedia:Healing}heal{/g} damage, breath of life can bring recently slain creatures back to life. If cast upon a creature that has died within 2 {g|Encyclopedia:Combat_Round}rounds{/g}, apply the healing from this spell to the creature. If the healed creature's {g|Encyclopedia:HP}hit point{/g} total is at a negative amount less than its {g|Encyclopedia:Constitution}Constitution{/g} score, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total. If the creature's hit point total is at a negative amount equal to or greater than its Constitution score, the creature remains dead. Creatures brought back to life through breath of life gain a temporary negative level that lasts for 1 day.
Creatures slain by death effects cannot be saved by breath of life.
Like cure spells, breath of life deals damage to undead creatures rather than curing them, and cannot bring them back to life.

22669	You create a magical trap in the area that causes deadly stalactites or stalagmites to "bite" an intruder. The magical trap is triggered whenever an enemy creature moves through the affected area. The effect of cave fangs depends on whether you create stalactites or stalagmites (see below). You can place these traps anywhere within close range as {g|Encyclopedia:Free_Action}free action{/g} for the duration of the {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g}; the trap's radius is 5 feet. Each time you place a trap, the spell's duration is reduced by 10 minutes.
Stalactites: Shards of rock drop from above, dealing {g|Encyclopedia:Dice}3d8{/g} points of {g|Encyclopedia:Damage_Type}bludgeoning and piercing damage{/g} ({g|Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw}Reflex{/g} half). A creature that fails its Reflex save is pinned to the ground under stalactites and rubble, gaining the {g|ConditionEntangled}entangled{/g} condition until it can free itself with a successful {g|Encyclopedia:DC}DC{/g} 15 {g|Encyclopedia:Strength}Strength{/g} {g|Encyclopedia:Check}check{/g} or DC 20 {g|Encyclopedia:Mobility}Mobility{/g} check.
Stalagmites: Piercing spires of rock erupt up from the ground, dealing 3d8 points of piercing damage and knocking the creature {g|ConditionProne}prone{/g} (a successful Reflex saving throw halves this damage and avoids being knocked prone). Once the stalagmites appear, they function thereafter as {g|SpellsSpikeStones}spike stones{/g} for 1 minute per {g|Encyclopedia:Caster_Level}caster level{/g} and then crumble to dust.	Vytvoříš magickou past v oblasti, která způsobí, že smrtící stalaktity či stalagmity „kousnou“ vetřelce. Magická past se spustí vždy, kdy nepřátelská bytost projde postiženou oblastí.

22724	You create an extradimensional hole with a depth of 10 feet per two {g|Encyclopedia:Caster_Level}caster levels{/g} (maximum 100 feet). The pit has the ability to squeeze and crush any creature trapped within it.
Any large or smaller creature standing in the area where you first conjured the pit must make a {g|Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw}Reflex saving throw{/g} to jump to safety in the nearest open space. In addition, the edges of the pit are sloped, and any creature ending its turn in a space adjacent to the pit must make a Reflex saving throw with a +2 {g|Encyclopedia:Bonus}bonus{/g} to avoid falling into it. Creatures subjected to an effect intended to push them into the pit (such as bull rush) do not get a saving throw to avoid falling in if they are affected by the pushing effect.
Creatures who fall into the pit take falling {g|Encyclopedia:Damage}damage{/g} as normal ({g|Encyclopedia:Dice}1d6{/g} {g|Encyclopedia:Damage_Type}bludgeoning damage{/g} per 10 feet). In addition, anyone within the pit takes 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage each {g|Encyclopedia:Combat_Round}round{/g} as the pit contracts and then returns to its normal {g|Encyclopedia:Size}size{/g} (a successful Reflex save halves this damage). The ever-shifting walls of the pit are quite difficult to scale: to climb them, a creature needs a successful {g|Encyclopedia:Athletics}Athletics{/g} or {g|Encyclopedia:Mobility}Mobility{/g} {g|Encyclopedia:Skills}skill{/g} {g|Encyclopedia:Check}check{/g} with a {g|Encyclopedia:DC}DC{/g} of 35. When the duration of the {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g} ends, creatures within the hole rise up with the bottom of the pit until they are standing on the surface over the course of a single round.

22761	You restore life to a deceased party member. A raised creature has a number of {g|Encyclopedia:HP}hit points{/g} equal to its current HD. Raise dead also removes the {g|Encyclopedia:Injury_Death}death's{/g} door condition.
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g} gains two permanent negative levels when it is raised, just as if it had been hit by an energy-draining creature, though it can not gain a number of negative levels equal to or greater than its total {g|Encyclopedia:Hit_Dice}Hit Dice{/g} this way.
A creature whose permanent negative levels already equal its Hit Dice cannot be brought back to life through raise dead.	Obnovíš život zemřelému členovi družiny.

22763	You must have a melee weapon in hand to cast this {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g}.
On a successful {g|Encyclopedia:MeleeAttack}melee attack{/g}, your weapon resounds. The target takes {g|Encyclopedia:Dice}1d6{/g} points of {g|Encyclopedia:Energy_Damage}sonic damage{/g}. Your weapon is not harmed by this {g|Encyclopedia:Attack}attack{/g}.
If you are using your judgment ability or smite ability against the target, it is {g|ConditionStaggered}staggered{/g} for 1 {g|Encyclopedia:Combat_Round}round{/g} on a successful attack. A successful {g|Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw}Fortitude save{/g} negates the staggering effect.
On a successful {g|Encyclopedia:Critical}critical hit{/g}, the target is {g|ConditionStunned}stunned{/g} for 1 round and {g|ConditionBlind}blinded{/g} for 1d6 rounds. A successful Fortitude save negates the stunning and blindness effects. If you are also using judgment or smite, your foe makes only a single save against all effects.
This spell immediately ends if your weapon leaves your hand.

Make a ranged {g|Encyclopedia:TouchAttack}touch attack{/g} against the target. A creature hit by this {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g} is wracked by painful spasms as its muscles and sinews wither and twist.
The subject takes {g|Encyclopedia:Dice}1d4{/g} points of {g|Encyclopedia:Dexterity}Dexterity{/g} and {g|Encyclopedia:Strength}Strength{/g} {g|Encyclopedia:AbilityDamage}damage{/g} per 3 {g|Encyclopedia:Caster_Level}caster levels{/g} you possess (maximum 5d4 each).

Depending on the target's {g|Encyclopedia:Hit_Dice}HD{/g}, this {g|Encyclopedia:Attack}attack{/g} has as many as three effects:
If the target's HD is 10 or more, it is {g|ConditionSickened}sickened{/g} for 10 minutes per {g|Encyclopedia:Caster_Level}caster level{/g}.
If the target's HD is 5–9, it is {g|ConditionFrightened}frightened{/g} and sickened for 10 minutes per caster level.
If the target's HD is 4 or less, it is {g|ConditionParalyzed}paralyzed{/g}, frightened, and sickened
The effects are cumulative and concurrent for 10 minutes per caster level.

If the creature's HD is up to your caster level — 5, it is {g|ConditionParalyzed}paralyzed{/g} and blinded.
If the creature's HD is up to your caster level — 10, it is killed, paralyzed, and blinded.
The effects are cumulative and concurrent. A successful {g|Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw}Will save{/g} reduces or eliminates these effects. Creatures affected by multiple effects make only one save and apply the result to all of the effects. Creatures whose {g|Encyclopedia:Hit_Dice}Hit Dice{/g} are equal to or exceed your caster level are unaffected by holy word.

This healing can even bring back to life party members that have died within 2 {g|Encyclopedia:Combat_Round}rounds{/g}.

You gain a +4 enhancement {g|Encyclopedia:Bonus}bonus{/g} to {g|Encyclopedia:Strength}Strength{/g}, {g|Encyclopedia:Dexterity}Dexterity{/g}, and {g|Encyclopedia:Constitution}Constitution{/g}, a +4 natural armor bonus to {g|Encyclopedia:Armor_Class}AC{/g}, a +5 competence bonus on {g|Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw}Fortitude saves{/g}, and proficiency with all simple and {g|Encyclopedia:Weapon_Proficiency}martial weapons{/g}. Your {g|Encyclopedia:BAB}base attack bonus{/g} equals your {g|Encyclopedia:Character_Level}character level{/g} (but not higher than 20), which may give you multiple {g|Encyclopedia:Attack}attacks{/g}.	Stáváš se bojeschopným strojem — silnějším, odolnějším, rychlejším a zručnějším v boji. Tvoje mysl se změní tak, že si boj užíváš, a nejsi schopen sesílat {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}kouzla{/g}, ani z magických předmětů.	too_short:0.26

30216	A treatise by the highborn and powerful ruler, His Excellency the esteemed Count Bartolo Mezinas
Westcrown Royal Publishing. Approved by the censors.
"From time to time, we see some politician unacquainted with warfare but driven by false humanity propose an absurd thought — that wars are somehow supposed to be fought in the open field, away from cities, and only between professional armies so as to avoid casualties among so-called 'non-combatants,' even if they are on the side of the enemy. The supporters of this ludicrous belief must be mistaking war for a tourney where fighters clash in mock battles, their swords clanging against shields as they avoid striking at the stomach or the head for fear of inadvertently delivering a mortal blow — in other words, achieving what would be their goal in real combat. Unlike mock fights, real war is a continuation of politics that utilizes force with the purpose of establishing the dominion of one group of people over another. And since power is the origin point of all morality, it goes without saying that no moral standards that may be customary in everyday life can impose limitations on power struggles — for the victor will be the one who determines those same standards.
When one wants to catch fish, one goes to the river, and when one wants to hunt game, ones goes to the forest — the natural habitat of one's prey, where it feeds, breeds, and rests. So if the prey is a human being, where else is one to go if not to the city? The city is where laws are passed, deals are made, treatises are written, and songs are composed. While pursuing the goal of subjugating a hostile society, one must begin by attacking its cities instead of wasting time maneuvering one army around another."

38216	The thief named Laffar was a true worshiper of Norgorber. For him his craft was the most sacred of the arts, therefore he never cut a pouch from a carefree passer-by or purloined a shiny trinket that might lie in temptation's way. Laffar chose only impossible goals and Norgorber helped him. When he finally came to believe that no treasures were worthy of him, Laffar decided to steal from his god. He did this not out of greed, but to prove his skill, and thus luck was on his side.
Having snatched a relic called the Stone of Ghostly Pathways from the abode of Norgorber, Laffar absconded, with cloaks rustling and daggers flashing behind his back. No matter how far north the crafty thief went, his pursuers kept on his tail, and soon Laffar realized that he was doomed. He threw the stolen stone into a pile of rubble and accepted his fate with a happy smile. Norgorber's servants never found the stolen relic, which meant that Laffar's trick ultimately met with success.
According to legend, after many centuries, the Stone of Ghostly Pathways fell into the hands of a shaman who lived near there. His guiding spiritual instinct led him to acquire this unremarkable stone. Was it a spiritual instinct, however, or was it the spirit of Laffar, the thief who had stolen from his god and who had finally decided to reveal where the forgotten relic had been hiding?	Zloděj jménem Laffar byl skutečným ctitelem Norgorbera. Pro něj bylo jeho řemeslo nejsvátější z umění, a proto nikdy neodřízl pytlíček bezstarostnému kolemjdoucímu ani neodcizil blyštivou cetku, která by mohla svádět. Laffar si vybíral pouze nemožné cíle a Norgorber mu pomáhal. Když konečně uvěřil, že žádné poklady mu nejsou hodny, rozhodl se Laffar ukrást od svého boha. Nečinil to ze chamtivosti, ale aby předvedl své umění, a štěstí mu bylo nakloněno.	too_short:0.33
38224	Captain Kerz became famous among the pirates of the Abyss after he slew the legendary monster called the Colorless One. This monstrosity spawned from the calcified remains of demon lord Colyphyr. His body became an island, his blood became crystals, and the disgusting ichor that seeped through the isle's crags gave life to a monster — a crystalline ooze of mythic proportions. Silent and unseen, the creature slid through the waves of Ishiar, waiting for airships. When spotting prey, its tendrils shot out of the water like monumental pillars and shattered decks into splinters. The translucent slime engulfed the sailors' bodies and slowly dissolved them. The Colorless One also attacked border settlements, devouring everything in its path and leaving nothing except bloody ooze and acid-scarred buildings behind. No weapon or spell could overcome this beast.
For Captain Kerz, hunting the Colorless One was a challenge. Stalking the beast in Ishiar for three years, he figured out that the Colorless One regularly returned to Colyphyr to recover its strength and drink from springs tainted with the ichor of its progenitor. Kerz set up an ambush next to one of such riverlets, catching the Colorless One unaware. He gave a signal, and the fire spells ignited, encircling the mound of predatory slime with an incendiary wall. The creature boiled, foamed, and raged in the trap but could not break out. The thing was dying... but too slowly. The fire magic ran its course, and the incendiary wall began to fade. The Colorless One attacked, grabbing the pirates, and devouring them one after the other.
The outcome of the fight hung by a thread when a flaming arrow streaked through the sky — it was "Rabid Bitch," Captain Kerz's airship, and he was piloting her straight into the Colorless One. Her sails and her hull were ablaze, lit by the pirate's steady hand. The captain himself stood at the helm. The burning vessel struck the pile of slime like a battering ram, and an explosion shook the island. The monster's chunks were tossed hundreds of feet away, where they writhed helplessly and dried into crystalline powder.
Wafts of poisonous smoke rose to the sky and a toxic cloud swelled over the site of the explosion. And it was from that cloud that Captain Kerz triumphantly emerged — much to the joy of his remaining crew — covered in burns and sores left by the caustic slime, but alive and victorious. The tale of his hunt became a legend among the denizens of the Abyss, and the Colorless One became a small pile of crystallic refuse. However, it still retained a modicum of its terrifying power.	Kapitán Kerz získal slávu mezi piráty propasti poté, co zabil legendární monstrum zvané Colorless One. Toto monstro vzniklo z zkamenělých pozůstatků démona Colyphyra. Jeho tělo se stalo ostrovem, jeho krev krystaly a odporný žlout, který prosakoval skalami ostrova, dal život nestvůře — krystalické slizu mýtických rozměrů. Tiché a neviditelné se stvoření klouzalo vichřemi Ishiaru, čekající na vzducholodě. Když spatřilo kořist, jeho chapadla vystřelila z vody jako monumentální pilíře a rozbila paluby na špalíky. Průsvitná šlacha obalila těla námořníků a pomalu je rozložila. Colorless One také napadal hraniční osady, požírajíc vše na své cestě a nezanechávajíc nic než krvavý sliz a budovy zohavené kyselinou. Žádná zbraň ani kouzlo nedokázaly porazit toto zvíře.	too_short:0.29
38233	Djail Kann was an eccentric and capricious demon, indifferent to power and violence but a great lover of riddles and puzzles. It was he who captured the mysterious Collector that had been preying upon Alushinyrra's nobility and it was he who returned Ar-Mikheth's stolen golden carbuncle, but his most famous investigation is by far the case of the burning gladiators.
One day, a bunch of slaves stepped onto the sand of the Battlebliss arena unbidden. They were cloaked in flames but did not scream, silently carrying the bodies of their slain jailers on the tips of their spears. Having formed a column before the demons, awestruck at the sight, they spoke in a single voice: "I have been taken from, so now I take." A moment later, they vanished in a conflagration that incinerated most of the spectators, leaving only charred words on the ashen floor of the arena: "For pain and fire."
This incident was just the beginning. The killings in the arena continued, with gladiators seemingly losing their minds and attacking the guards, catching fire, and burning to ash alongside their tormentors. All that remained were the cryptic words: "For pain and fire." Shamira the Ardent Dream commanded Djail to solve the mystery of these unusual deaths.
Djail took a cup of blood and on every wall of the arena, wrote the following: "I have taken from you. And I will take again." Having issued this challenge to the unknown killer, Djail waited — but not for long, because the bloody letters caught fire. Djail proclaimed he had solved the riddle and would reveal the answer to everyone on the next day. The next moment, a dozen thralls turned into pillars of flame and surrounded Djail. In a single voice, they asked: "Do you think you have exposed me, demon? What do you even know, you arrogant fiend?"
"I know your name. You are Nemarius, a demigod born of the goddess Sekhmet. You and your wife-to-be were captured and forced to fight to the death in the arena. She fell, and you set yourself on fire out of grief, but were never truly gone. Your spirit is bound to this object!" Smiling, Djail presented the brand used to mark the slaves as the arena's property. "I used my sorcerous sight to watch you light up my words, and I felt where the threads of your spells converge. This brand left its mark on your skin and the skin of your beloved bride. It was also used to mark the slaves whose minds you dominate and use as the instruments of your revenge. Or am I wrong?"
The burning gladiators howled in Nemarius's voice, but it was too late. Djail cast a spell on the brand that trapped the vengeful demigod, defeating and disempowering his foe.
The tradition of using hot iron to mark the gladiators ceased, and the fate of Nemarius's brand remains unknown up to this very day.	Djail Kann byl výstřední a rozmarný démon, lhostejný k moci a násilí, avšak velký milovník hádanek a rébusů. On zajal tajemného Collector, který terorizoval šlechtu Alushinyrra, a on vrátil Ar-Mikhethův ukradený zlatý karbunkl, ale jeho nejslavnějším vyšetřováním zůstává případ hořících gladiátorů.	too_short:0.11
38241	The followers of the demon lord Baphomet commit countless crimes to earn his favor. Kearius was a servant of Desna who was in charge of the temple shelter, but secretly worshiped the Lord of Beasts. He took advantage of his position to build a cunning maze in the temple's secret basement and filled it with fierce and bloodthirsty monsters. Each night, Kearius cast an overly trusting vagabond or a homeless person into the maze, where they met their grisly end.
The cultist spread heresy and depravity, corrupting the other priests. Baphomet took note of his servant's guile and bestowed an incredible gift upon him — a spark of the flame gracing the brow of the Lord of Monsters himself. The lantern containing this spark could summon fiery denizens of the Abyss, and its swaying could hypnotize or conjure terrifying illusions. Kearius enshrined the flame of his lord and master at the very heart of his maze.
But soon enough, an incredible thing happened. A lonely beggar boy — a frail and timid creature — fell into Kearius' clutches and was cast down into the maze. Somehow, he managed to survive and reach the very center of the trap. He reached out for the flame with his scraggly hands and was gone. Frightened and furious, Kearius found the empty shrine and set out to pursue the pilferer. He feared that Baphomet might learn about this failure and punish his negligent servant.
After a while, he learned of entire villages reduced to ash by fiery creatures, with the survivors driven insane by the eerie glow of a sinister flame. They raved and rambled about a frail beggar boy with hellish fire in the palm of his hands.
Kearius tracked the young man down. Fear tugged at his heart and nudged him toward madness. When he finally reached the boy, the beggar laughed and turned into a cocky young man, decked in the garb of a Baphomet cultist. The grinning rogue said it was the Lord of Monsters himself who had inspired him to steal the unholy flame, and even devised the guise of the feeble child. Kearius's failure would be his downfall, and the sneaky thief would take his place as Baphomet's most loyal servant. A fight broke out where both demon worshipers sought to destroy one another, but neither could gain the upper hand. When they became tired, the Lord of Beasts' flame slipped from the thief's sweaty hands and fell onto a pile of dead branches. Fiery creatures emerged from the fire and surrounded the weakened priests, the monsters' eyes glowing like embers. The cultists pleaded with their master for protection, but their appeals fell on deaf ears. The spawn of Baphomet's flame feasted on the sinners' flesh all night, and when the fire burned out, only a tiny spark of the unholy flame was left smoldering among the remains.	Následovníci démona-pána Baphometa páchají nespočet zločinů, aby si získali jeho přízeň. Kearius byl služebníkem Desny, který měl na starosti chrámové útočiště, ale potají uctíval Lord of Beasts. Využil svého postavení k vybudování lstivého bludiště v tajném suterénu chrámu a naplnil jej zuřivými, krvelačnými nestvůrami. Každou noc Kearius vrhl do bludiště přehnaně důvěřivého tuláka nebo bezdomovce, kde je čekal hrozný konec.	too_short:0.16
38248	Priests of Shelyn only speak the name of Francest, the Cursed Bard, in terrified whispers. There was a day when he was one of them, and his fame resounded from Varisia to Andoran. He traveled the world with a song and a smile, and a lovely wife at his side. He dreamt of creating the Song of All and spent years gathering sounds and notes for the melody that would encompass the entire Creation in supreme harmony. The laughter of a child and the confession of love, the triumphant cry and the gentle lullaby — all became sources for his inspiration. The journey brought the husband and wife to Drezen, where the great bard sang for the soldiers to inspire them before battle, but one night darkness descended upon Francest.
"You are gathering only the notes of joy, bard," it whispered mockingly. "But there are so many other sounds you have never heard before," it murmured. "Pay me with the blood of your love, and I will reveal them to you." Francest attempted to resist Nocticula's seductive voice, but to no avail — by dawn, his hand reached for the knife on its own accord.
He walked through the city streets covered in his wife's blood, singing a song with a happy smile on his face, and nobody dared to stop him — so terrifying and powerful was his voice. The call brought Francest to Alushinyrra where he kept gathering the notes to compose the Song of All: the cries of a mother whose children were butchered in front of her, the moans of a warrior whose hands were being chopped off, the wailing of lovers who would never see each other again. His cruelty astonished even demons. He murdered and tortured women and men, but the smile never left his face.
Years went by, and the Song of All was almost complete. The Cursed Bard was lacking one final chord. He came to the Fleshmarkets and walked among slaves, treating them to sweet wine and even sweeter songs. The thralls watched him with hope and timid smiles. They gratefully accepted the cup he offered, but wine's tangy aftertaste quickly gave way to searing pain. The bard's wine casket was full of poison that liquefied innards, and the moans of the dying joined Francest's song as its final note.
The Cursed Bard drank the bitter dregs himself. He sang as he lay dying... and was happy. The demons listened to his performance with bated breath. It was the Song of All Wicked, a hymn to the darkest night where the cursed fire burns bright.
When Francest fell silent, his body was reduced to rancid ooze. The poison spared only the bard's vocal cords, which the demons preserved as a grisly relic. They became a memento of the most frightful, the most remorseless song Alushinyrra ever heard.	Kněží Shelyn vyslovují jméno Francest, the Cursed Bard, jen v vyděšených šepotech. Byl dnem, kdy byl jedním z nich, a jeho sláva se nesla od Varisie až po Andoran. Putoval světem s písní na rtech a úsměvem, po boku měl milou manželku. Sníval o stvoření Song of All a roky sbíral zvuky a tóny pro melodii, která by obsáhla celé Stvoření v nejvyšší harmonii. Smích dítěte i vyznání lásky, vítězný jekot i něžná ukolébavka — to vše bylo zdrojem jeho inspirace. Cesta zavedla manžele do Drezen, kde velký bard zpíval vojákům, aby je před bitvou povzbuzoval, ale jedné noci se nad Francestem snesla temnota.	too_short:0.23

39492	After capturing Drezen the crusaders raised the three Morale Banners on the city walls:
* The Banner of Victories stays green while you defeat demon armies. Each victory over a demon Army in Lands of Yath, Gray Road, Lake Lost to the Sun, and Wintersun Lands regions adds 6 days to the time the Banner of Victories stays green.
* The Banner of Conquest stays green while you capture demon forts. Each capture of a demon fort in Lands of Yath, Gray Road, Lake Lost to the Sun, and Wintersun Lands regions adds 30 days to the time the Banner of Conquest stays green. Reclaiming forts that were previously lost does not affect the Banner of Conquest.
* The Banner of Defense remains green as long as none of your forts are under siege. If any of your forts is besieged, the Banner of Defense turns yellow for 3 days, then turns red. As long as any fort remains captured by the demons, this Banner remains red.
Banners still affect the daily change of crusade morale. A red Banner decreases morale by 3 per day, a yellow or green Banner increases it by 1 per day.	Po dobytí Drezen křižáci vztyčili na hradbách města tři prapory morálky:	too_short:0.07

3. Don't even think of setting foot in the ritual chamber. Ever.
4. Keep the door to the unfinished section of the Maze locked at all times. As a reminder for you feebleminded vermin: the entrance is sealed using the hidden lever — the torch on the wall next to the door. The door itself is in the room with the blood pool where I sometimes relax.
5. Do something about that damn water elemental already! Do whatever you want with it, just make sure it's gone by tomorrow!

General Tertius Wharl's Drinkware — a set of crystal glasses and a decanter. This very set was served at General Wharl's last dinner. Shortly after the beginning of the feast, the general received a message saying that Queen Galfrey had uncovered his treason and his pact with the demons. Her knights were already on their way to his residence with an order for his arrest. The general succumbed to his cowardice and chose to die of poison, refusing to go through the courts and receive his punishment with honor. It is unclear which glass the general himself used to drink the poisoned wine from, and which one was used by Vivilla, his wife and associate, and also a witch. This exhibit was donated to the museum by General Wharl's family.
Captain Lykos's Funeral Urn — Captain Lykos was in charge of 30 scouts during the Third Crusade. His unit consisted mostly of fresh recruits who had only recently arrived in Mendev. When they stumbled upon one of the last bands of Sarkorian refugees fleeing the territory occupied by demons, they decided to rob the poor people instead of escorting them to safety. Captain Lykos tried to bring his soldiers to heel, but they pulled him off his horse and tore his body to pieces in the ensuing chaos. The Sarkorians delivered Lykos's remains to Kenabres as a token of gratitude for his brave attempt to protect them.
The Dark Horn — the glaive of a mighty minotaur who led one of the countless assaults on Mendevian territory. Sir Ravignon's last trophy. Sir Ravignon was a paladin once, but his debauchery, vices, and heavy drinking caused him to lose the favor of Iomedae. After that, he sought the goddess's mercy by any means possible. According to witnesses, during the battle with the Dark Horn's owner, Sir Ravignon regained his ability to cast spells, and his weapon shone and gave off a blistering heat. He apparently had succeeded in atoning for his sins and the Inheritor found him worthy of one last blessing for his final battle. This weapon was donated to the museum by Knight Couvarro, Sir Ravignon's illegitimate son.
The Grace of Peace — the blade that once belonged to a crusader named Whist who served his duty at a vanguard fort near Kenabres. When the fort was put under siege, the majority of the soldiers committed treason, killed the commander, and tried to join the demonic forces. Whist wasn't among them, however. He executed the traitors and managed to leave the doomed fort without being seen. For the next ten days, he stealthily dogged the demons, killing them whenever he could. After several failed attempts to track Whist down, the demons reanimated his former comrades and put them on his trail. The brave crusader granted all of them the eternal grace of peace and, gravely wounded, went on to Kenabres to warn the guards about the approaching enemy army. This item was donated to the museum by the Town Hall of Kenabres.
Lady Callandra's Chainmail — the armor of the famed inquisitor and warrior, Lady Callandra. She personally exposed and executed more than a hundred demon spies hiding among the сrusaders. The demons hated her for her perception and insight and made no less than seven failed attempts on her life. It is believed that she never removed her faithful mail, not even when she slept. Lady Callandra died when a traitor planted a venomous snake in her bed."	Seznam exponátů: General Tertius Wharl's Drinkware — sada křišťálových sklenic a karafy. Tato právě sada byla podána při poslední večeři General Tertius Wharl. Krátce po začátku hostiny generál obdržel zprávu, že Queen Galfrey odhalila jeho zradu a pakt s démony. Její rytíři byli již na cestě k jeho sídlu s rozkazem k jeho zatčení. Generál podlehl své zbabělosti a zvolil smrt jedem, odmítl projít soudem a přijmout trest v čestném duchu. Není jasné, ze které sklenice generál sám pil otrávené víno a která patřila Viville, jeho manželce a spojenky, která byla také čarodějkou.

"To anyone who can help us —
My name is Harkel, and I'm chief of the Nasty Waifs gang. Recently we raided the Tower of Estrod in Kenabres, and with Norgorber's blessing we took quite a haul. We hid in a reliable place with bad reputation, somewhere the law would never think of going. We were celebrating our success when Quickrick appeared and choked two of our friends to death. We knew things were bad, because Quickrick had already been dead for about four hours. The old man was a drunk, and his heart had failed on the steep mountain roads. Terrified, we chopped Quickrick into pieces. But a few hours later he came for us again, and he brought with him the two he killed earlier. That's when the real nightmare began, something so bad the mind can't take it. Corpses came back to life, howling, screaming in pain and rage, and killing. The way they killed...
Even now we're sitting in a cave, keeping a wall of fire burning with oil sanctified by the priests of Iomedae. It's the only thing separating us from the mob of walking corpses we once called friends. Praise Norgorber, we took an oil vessel with us from the Tower of Estrod. It won't last another day, if the heat doesn't kill us quicker.
Looks like the Nasty Waifs are done. So, here's our offer. If you can get to Dry River Canyon and get us out of here, we'll honestly return all the loot, show you all our hiding spots, empty our pockets, confess to everything, and accept any punishment except for the gallows. If you want, we'll even sign up to be crusaders. We'd rather die in the mouth of a demon than suffer here forever with our friends.
I know my comrades well, and the man who planted this letter for you will have long ago escaped to the south. I beg you — here's the exact location of the place where the Nasty Waifs are making their final stand.
If you have a drop of mercy in you, save our souls.

47320	Thinking upon what he's just learned about vescavors, Lann orders his squad to remove their armor. It won't protect them from the beasts, but it will affect their speed and stealth.
The soldiers hesitate, outrage plain on their faces. This new commander is an underground savage, a subhuman, little better than a half-demon, and a snot-nosed kid besides who's barely seen two dozen summers. Who is he to dish out orders to veteran crusaders, and as they march toward certain doom to boot? But discipline reins in their thoughts, and reluctantly they fall in behind him.

47324	Arrogance plays a cruel joke on the Paralictor of the Hellknights, as he prepares to fulfill his promise to stand firm, "even as the swarm tears the flesh from our bones." These are precisely the orders he's given his troops.
The swarm falls upon them like a raging storm. Hellknights are better armored than regular soldiers, and some are even wearing adamantine. Some have vials of acid, which can wound and deter vescavors for a time.
But the beasts are beyond number, so many that they cannot but find openings in the armor and wriggle their way inside. While one insect is burned with acid, five others circle and strike. A moment later, Regill's troops are a living graveyard, his knights buried under a layer of wriggling and buzzing beasts.	Arogance si dělá krutou legraci s Paralictorem Hellknights, když se chystá splnit svůj slib stát pevně, "i když hejno trhá maso z našich kostí."

48984	"On the nature of rifts
That which we call a 'rift' is in fact close to the complete opposite — a 'suture' or a 'tie.' It is the place where two planes are stitched together, enmeshed to the point of merging.
Two types of rifts are encountered on the borders of the Worldwound — short-term natural rifts and stable, engineered rifts. The latter allow entire armies to pass freely between the Abyss and Golarion. They were created at points where the fabric of reality formed a specific type of 'fold,' where the Material Plane was closest to the Abyss. More information about these 'folds of reality' in former Sarkoris can be found in the Temple of Stone Manuscripts in the ruined city of Iz. Some of my own notes are also held there. I shall only make passing reference to them here.
At the moment of writing, five of these 'folds' have been identified. The most significant one was located near the Threshold fortress, and it was that which made the Worldwound possible. The second most significant rift, the Maiming of Iz, marks the ruins of the famous city. The third rift — the Gates of Midnight — is hidden in the Midnight Fane. The fourth — the Harrowing — leads to my personal laboratory. And, finally, the fifth — the Blood of Pulura — is located near the Sarkorian shrine.
All of the rifts within the perimeter of the Wound function as a single system. In a way, they are like a single entity, or offshoots from a single root. This means that closing them separately is impossible. They will disappear only when the source is uprooted, the main rift — that which some people call the Last Threshold, although it is in fact the true and original Worldwound.
The Wound cannot be closed using ordinary methods. The very manner in which it was opened protects it from interference. The only means of closing it requires..."

"...telepathy — a dead end. I need a way to control the insects directly, with my will alone, bypassing conscious thought entirely."
"Parasitism/symbiosis? Test subjects' skin is gradually ingested, replaced by the swarm. Result: failure. How do I stop them from eating through tissue?"

62995	"Key to the Last Threshold
Many mortal researchers have ventured to turn their scientific curiosity on the phenomenon that is the Worldwound, noting that 'it appears to have a life of its own.' Strange natural phenomena, spontaneously arising ruptures, unique vegetation, and living creatures found neither on Golarion nor in the Abyss, everything is constantly in flux, appearing and disappearing at unpredictable intervals. Through this movement and alteration, if not through its order, one can detect the logical functioning of the organs of a living being.
The truth is that, indeed, the Worldwound possesses a semblance of life, and its very structure presupposes a connection to a living soul. This line of reasoning sometimes leads me to... unscientific implications. Namely, if the creation is in essence a reflection of the creator, then can we say that the Worldwound is a reflection of my soul?
The Worldwound was created and then improved, and at the same time, a being of duality was cobbled together from the essence of the Abyss and the essence of a mortal soul. Normally, this process requires an essence taken from a creature with strength comparable to that of an empyreal or Abyssal lord, but there are ways to circumvent this requirement. In particular, through the use of the Nahyndrian crystal's rare power.
In this section, I refer to this being as the 'Key,' an instrument that allowed me to significantly expand and strengthen my original creation. Due to {mf|his|her} dual nature and connection to the Worldwound, the Key was given the opportunity to obtain amazing powers. However, everything has a price. The Worldwound is linked to the Key, but the Key is also linked to the Worldwound, and carries it in {mf|his|her} soul, like a deadly affliction.
This affliction is, indeed, fatal. The duality of the soul grants amazing powers, and primes the soul's owner for Transformation and for the bestowing of incredible abilities. But this duality is also slowly killing the soul's owner. This is a problem I have yet to solve."	"Klíč k poslední hranici	too_short:0.01

"It is said that in times past, there lived a blind mortal woman. Robbed of daylight from birth, without ever having seen the true world around her, she lost her mind at a young age and felt a strange passion for things others avoided like the plague. Above all other pleasures and joys of this world, she cherished death, for..."

"Even though the fate was cruel to her, the woman, dubbed the Ashen Lady, was a kind and generous soul — especially toward those who were to her liking. To them, she would give the most precious gift she could imagine — death. The most artful and beautiful of the ends she granted was the ashen death..." The page is torn, but you can still make out the writing under the bedraggled edge, "Amateur!"
"Many a mortal was sent to a better place by the Ashen Lady, for she was incredibly skilled and deft at her craft. Seemingly weak and helpless, she could bring out the pity and compassion in those dear to her, and these emotions were followed by a swift death. No one could believe that a blind woman was capable of the kind of treachery and stealth that the Ashen Lady employed. Only those who were destined to die by her hand knew the secret — she would mark her victims with a curse and then follow its scent like a tireless hound." You notice a scrawling on the side of the page that reads, "Drivel."
"The Ashen Lady would have brought much more misery to her friends and loved ones, had she not received retribution for her sins. Upon hearing word that some crafty murderer had surpassed their own misdeeds with her grim accomplishments, Baphomet's cultists disposed of their rival — they captured her and dragged her down into the Abyss." A scribble on the side reads, "Serves her right! Let the wretch waste away in our cells!"

I would also ask to abolish the need to keep watch over Alderpash's cells — any guard assigned to his chambers gets immediately corrupted by his bribes and promises, becomes his spy, and then has to be executed at once as a warning to the rest.
Beyond that, I would like to report the preposterous behavior of the priestess Svendack — she keeps taking my warriors to perform her sacrifices and demanding that my sorcerers restore the magical barrier around some empty cage every cycle.

Of course, the plane-forming principle is well known, and is quite typical for everything that originates from the Abyss. When there are two things of the same kind, one will try to suppress the other... or devour it. That is why a source of Nahyndrian power will block all other sources of the same power.
However, I've never succeeded in creating a Nahyndrian demon capable of suppressing the Nahyndrian powers of other demons. This outcome is theoretically possible — in fact, it is theoretically probable.
Yet for some reason, all my attempts to create such a demon have ended in failure. So I decided to try a different approach... and it has yielded some excellent results. I have managed to create a Nahyndrian angel capable of suppressing a demon's Nahyndrian powers. Now, this can happen only once, because it requires the subject's termination. But who cares? Angels are expendable. If I manage to recreate the process that Areelu used when implanting Targona's wing, I'll be able to make a dozen of these 'anti-Nahyndrian bombs.'

The Clock of Axis is highly sensitive to anomalous phenomena and is liable to stop completely in times of crisis. Certain objects in Axis collected under the oversight of the goddess Brigh are connected to the Clock of Axis and will cease to function if it does.
If the need arises to restart the Axis objects, the alarm on the Clock of Axis should be set to the starting position — the beginning of the day. The ringing of the Clock will awaken the remaining mechanisms.
Warning: a restart must never be performed in a time of crisis. All anomalies must be eradicated before doing so.
Warning: setting the Clock of Axis in the opposite starting position may provoke a critical failure in the Clock's operation and trigger secondary mechanisms in that sector of Axis. This function may be used only with my personal approval.

You are already ten years old as I write these words. I don't know when you will read them, or if you will ever get the chance — I am writing to you from a city besieged by a demonic horde, in the last crusader stronghold, minutes before the battle that may very well be our last. I have put off writing this account year after year, but now that I can feel death breathing down my neck, I thought it was finally time to pick up a quill.
I don't doubt that in our noble family, my name is either mired in disgrace or consigned to obscurity. I am called a coward and a traitor, one who forsook his homeland and his family. It doesn't matter to me. As I see it, I owe nothing to the Great House Garess — they gave me life, yes, but they took my childhood and my youth, denying me love and friendship, joy and happiness. I owe them nothing. But to you, my son, I owe the truth.
I never loved your mother, nor she me — marriages amongst the nobility are not brokered for love. When a Brevic aristocrat says the word 'love,' he means 'obedience.' It was in the name of 'love' that your great-grandfather bid me 'love' that woman — and I obeyed, to my sorrow and hers. I comforted myself with the hope that our union would prove fruitless, for I knew I would be unable to give you anything but that same northern 'love' — that cold cruelty that speaks its name in screams and floggings.
I resolved to flee when I understood everything with clarity: Brevoy was doomed to civil war. For too long had its two halves, Rostland and Issia, suffered under the yoke of this forced marriage, as your own parents had. I counted among my friends many heroes of Restov who bore the illustrious name Aldori. I knew I would be forced to raise my sword against them when the Great Houses decided to destroy the very thought of an independent Rostland. It was a burden I knew I could not bear.
I turned my back on my homeland and my family and fled to Mendev to join the crusaders. Whatever horrors awaited me in a war against evil incarnate, they could not be more terrifying than the fratricidal slaughter that was coming for Brevoy. In Mendev I could be sure who my friends were and who was the enemy. Here I need not wonder if I am fighting for a just cause. Here is where I learned what love is, real love.
Goodbye, my son. Know that I regret nothing. I found my truth — I hope you will find yours.

Quilessy Garess, Foot Soldier of the Crusader Army of Her Majesty Queen Galfrey of Mendev" -> "Můj synu, je ti už deset let, kdy tyto řádky píši. Nevím, kdy je budeš číst, ani zda vůbec dostaneš tu šanci — píši ti z města obléhaného démonickou hordou, v poslední křižácké pevnosti, minuty před bitvou, která může být i naší poslední. Odkládal jsem psaní tohoto záznamu rok za rokem, ale nyní, když cítím smrt dýchat na zátylek, myslím, že je konečně čas uchopit peří. Nepochybuji, že v naší urozené rodině je mé jméno buď zhanobené, nebo zapomenuté. Nazývají mě zbabělcem a zrádcem, tím, kdo zradil svou vlast a rodinu. To mi nevadí. Jak to vidím, nic nedlužím Velkému domu Garess — dali mi život, ano, ale vzali mi dětství i mládí, odepřeli mi lásku i přátelství, radost a štěstí. Nic jim nedlužím. Tobě však, můj synu, dlužím pravdu. Nikdy jsem nemiloval tvou matku, ani ona mne — sňatky mezi šlechtou se neusuzují podle lásky. Když Brevický aristokrat řekne slovo „láska“, myslí tím „poslušnost“. Ve jménu „lásky“ nařídil mi tvůj pradědeček, abych si tu ženu „miloval“ — a já jsem poslušně následoval, k mé i její škodě. Uvídal jsem se nadějí, že naše svazek zůstane plodný, neboť jsem věděl, že nebudu schopen dát ti nic než tu samou severní „lásku“ — tu chladnou krutost, která se projevuje v výkřicích a fackách. Rozhodl jsem se uprchnout, když jsem vše pochopil s jasností: Brevoy bylo odsouzeno ke vnitřní válce. Příliš dlouho jeho dvě poloviny, Rostland a Issia, trpěly pod jhem tohoto vnuceného sňatku, jako trpěli i tvoji rodiče. Mezi přáteli jsem měl mnoho hrdinů z Restovu, kteří nosili slavné jméno Aldori. Věděl jsem, že budu muset vzít meč proti nim, až Velké domy rozhodnou zničit představu nezávislého Rostlandu. Bylo to břemeno, které jsem věděl, že neunesu. Otočil jsem se zády ke své vlasti i rodině a uprchl jsem do Mendevu, abych se přidal ke křižákům. Jakékoli hrůzy mě čekaly v boji proti ztělesněnému zlu, nemohly být děsivější než bratrovražedné pobíjení, které se chystalo na Brevoy. V Mendevu jsem si mohl být jistý, kdo jsou přátelé a kdo nepřátelé. Tady se nemusím ptát, zda bojuji za spravedlivou věc. Zde jsem se naučil, co je láska, opravdová láska. Sbohem, můj synu. Věz, že ničeho nelituji. Našel jsem svou pravdu — doufám, že najdeš tu svou. Quilessy Garess, pěšák Křižácké armády Jejího Veličenstva královny Galfrey z Mendev"	bilingual_arrow

"I am rolling a pearl of a rare pink hue in my palm. It is not the largest pearl in my collection, nor is it the most precious... and yet it is unique in its own right.
I have obtained riches through various means. Some things were taken by force, some claimed through trickery, some stolen, some found in hidden nooks of the universe... But before this pearl, no treasure in my collection had been gifted to me willingly.
It came as a surprise, but I have followers now. How? Where did they come from? Perhaps some mortals were impressed by the display of my might during my raid on the Material Plane? Or has some bookish demonologist discovered me like a star in the sky? It is anyone's guess — all I know is that I made no effort to furnish myself with mortal admirers. Yet here they are. They offer prayers, perform bloody rituals in my name — and, most importantly, send offerings. A strange feeling, but a pleasant one. Well, if it is their heart's desire to become my servants, I won't turn them down. I might even grant the most devoted a spell or two."

"My servants are trying my patience. They are diligent in their sacrifices, and it does please me — but they are also asking me for more and more spells. As if I have nothing better to do than answer their foolish prayers. And that's not all — a particularly pestilent individual among them nagged me for so long that I deigned to pay him a personal visit. At first my intention was to squash him like an annoying fly, but he had prepared such exuberant offerings and such skillful flattery that I ended up sparing him — even naming him my Archpriest.
Strange. No one had ever looked at me the way he did. I am used to servants and prisoners gazing at me with hatred, with fear, with the dull docility of a crushed spirit. But what I saw in that mortal's eyes was fascination. Adoration. Awe. It is certainly gratifying, yet also concerning. Is it wise to let a servant retain free will, even though his only current desire is to serve you? Goodwill is a flimsy collar. The whole point of shackles is that the one wearing them does not get to choose when they are put on or removed. What good is a servant who can simply change his mind?"

"It would seem that my self-proclaimed servants have utterly forgotten who is serving whom. All I keep hearing is give, give, give. Send me a spell, grant me the power to channel energy, raise this one from the dead, incinerate that one... And what do I get in return? A paltry trickle of offerings? I was quite capable of filling my treasure house on my own. Servile flattery? A fool's delectation — I don't need anyone's praise to see the extent of my greatness. What am I squandering my power on?
Their latest stunt was the last straw. Of their own volition, without asking me, they raided a temple of Abadar. True, their spoils were glorious. It was a sight to behold, watching my Archpriest tremble as he placed upon my altar a fine bauble — the gold circlet of the temple's prior, adorned both with blue diamonds and fresh spatters of sacerdotal blood and brains. Oh yes, I was delighted by the offering. But then what? A war with a deity? He is no demon lord or angel, he is one of the mightiest beings in all creation. As much as I would enjoy dipping my hands into the First Vault, I must be reasonable — that prize is beyond my reach for now. What if, because of mortal foolishness, I am assailed by legions of axiomites — and I don't have the strength to fight back because I have wasted all my powers on those insatiable leeches?"

"'Live honorably, demon lord! Today, I am giving you a second chance.'
The deadly spell that was about to fly from the angel's hand dissipates. I heave an involuntary sigh of relief, and I curse myself for this show of weakness. Defeated. Humiliated.
She stands before me, beaming with blinding light. My eyes fill with tears, but I cannot look away. Her snow-white wings, her long neck, the curves of her shoulders and hips. She is beautiful, more beautiful than all the treasures in the Abyss! There is no anger in her face, no hatred, no superiority. She is looking at me as if peering into my very soul. I feel naked before her.
'Farewell, Nahyndri.'
She vanishes in a flash of light. I reach out my hand, trying to catch her, hold her, stop her from leaving me. But still she leaves. I am left alone, and only a white feather, torn from her wing by my desperate hand, is proof of her existence.
Defeated. Humiliated. But unbroken. I clutch the feather tightly in my fist."	Když ho sebereš, pocítíš ozvěnu pradávné vzpomínky...	too_short:0.05

And at last, you have descended into the Abyss once more, into my own realm, just as before! My carefully prepared trap has snapped shut.
'Have you missed me, my dear?'
The angel turns away, avoiding my gaze. Unconquered, pure, sublime. Time has distorted her image in my mind's eye, and now I am absorbing it again, relishing her every feature.
'Now you will stay with me for eternity.' I clasp a small lock-shaped pendant around her wrist and hang the key around my neck. 'And here is my first gift to you. You cannot remove this pendant, or leave the Abyss, or send word to the Upper Planes. Now you are dead to everyone, but do not fret. I will give you all that you wish. You will enjoy being mine.'
'You don't have to do this,' she whispers without looking up.
I freeze in confusion. Of course I don't have to do this. But why wouldn't I?"	Když ho sebereš, pocítíš ozvěnu pradávné vzpomínky...	too_short:0.05

96947	The yellowed pages of this thick tome are peppered with notes. A gilded tassel marks the following fragment:
"...The story of Sithhud, who once ruled the icy Abyssal wasteland of Jhuvumirak, is a most curious one. Demon lords often choose or reshape their realms to suit their looks and tastes, and Sithhud, the Frozen Lord of the undead, was no exception. One may imagine what his realm looked like: boundless snowy plains, razor-sharp ice ridges, frozen bones of the dead piled in mounds, and vicious wind scouring the very flesh off the bones of the living... He held Jhuvumirak firmly in his three-fingered claw until another demon, Kostchtchie, began to look at his domain with envy.
Naturally egocentric and competitive, demons gain their supernatural strength by feasting on each other, and one who has consumed enough of their peers may become a nascent demon lord. These creatures are capable of challenging any sovereign master of the Abyss, but they are yet to attain their own titles. Kostchtchie was one such fledgling when he challenged Sithhud and overcame him, despite the considerable power imbalance. We can only assume that there was another factor that tipped the scales in the younger demon's favor, but the details of that battle remain shrouded in darkness. Perhaps Kostchtchie had a secret weapon of some kind — or perhaps Sithhud was vulnerable and unable to put up a good fight for some reason? We can hope that future generations of aspiring demonologists will unveil this mystery.
And so Kostchtchie took Sithhud's castle, and rules over Jhuvumirak to this day. And what of Sithhud himself? For a long time he was presumed dead, his soul slumbering eternally in the Rift of Repose — a remote and hidden corner of the Abyss where defeated demon lords go after their bodies' demise. However, more recent findings indicate that Sithhud only lost his rank, and not his life. This is the only known case of so-called "demotion" of a fully-fledged demon lord to the lower rank of a nascent one. He is without a doubt still hiding from The Deathless Frost somewhere in the mountains of Jhuvumirak, slowly regaining his strength and gathering his resources for a rematch."

96950	"...Throughout my entire career — from the very first, simplest spells to the most complicated works of arcane — I have pursued one goal: immortality. Having studied a number of widely known methods, I came to the conclusion that I would have to invent my own. I do not wish to become a ghoul; languishing in an artificial body does not entice me either; and reincarnation entails an impending risk of ending up trapped in the body of a frog or a mouse. No, my distinguished colleague, my goal is to attain immortality in my own body — alive, hale and if not young, then at least well-preserved. This is by no means an easy task, especially for those of us who cannot afford even a single vial of sun orchid elixir. A joke from our dearest mentor (may he rest in peace for all eternity) comes to mind: the Runelords performed a double mystery, discovering the secret of immortality — and still managing to take that secret to the grave. Still, if they were able to solve this mystery, then the answer does exist, and an inquisitive enough mortal mind should be able to find it. If only we knew where to look...
After the obvious methods had failed me, I turned to the more esoteric ones. Who knows? Maybe the key to immortality hides between the pages of some dusty tome on alchemy, geomancy or demonology, waiting for a wizard astute enough to juxtapose the obvious facts from various disciplines while everyone else fritters away their time on necromancy and transmutation? I started sifting through endless works on numerous subjects, filling my head to the brim with theories, facts, and speculations both useful and preposterous. A curious story in one of those tomes caught my eye — the story of Sithhud, a demon lord who had been "demoted" back to the nascent ranks after losing a fight to another demon (who was significantly weaker than Sithhud himself, mind you! How is that even possible? Secrets! Secrets everywhere...)
This memory sank deep and did not resurface for a good while.
Some time ago I found a mummified corpse while doing research in the ruins of an ancient frost giant settlement. Judging by the rich ornamental clothing, it was a chieftain, or perhaps a shaman. A jolt of pain pierced my body when I touched it, and I almost fainted — then the visions came. Sharp icy blades, colossal bones, ravenous wind whispering something unintelligible... I did not know how long that torturous experience lasted, but once I regained consciousness I immediately called off the expedition and hurried home, knowing that I needed a thorough examination and perhaps a healer's assistance. You know those tricky ancient curses better than I do, so I shall spare you the details of the research that followed. The conclusion is this: the ancient legend about the fall of Sithhud lives anew. I have put myself in the middle of that long-forgotten demon lord's story and he has become a part of my own story in return.
A small fraction of Sithhud's power found its way into my body when I touched that corpse. I can very roughly define it as a shard of his very soul... If demons have anything of the sort. This is the reason why Sithhud lost his realm to a weaker foe and managed to escape certain death at the same time: his soul was shattered into countless shards and hidden inside his servants' bodies! I do not have a viable hypothesis on how this could have happened yet, but I feel him calling these shards back. Rest assured, I shall not respond to this call. I don't intend to serve some monster from the Abyss. Instead, I will apply myself fully to studying the extraordinary properties of my very own shard and the abundant power it provides me. I sense that the coveted key to immortality is within my grasp, but I am afraid I will not be able to find it before old age claims me. That is why I would like to invite you, my dearest colleague, to..."
The bottom half of the letter is stained with spilled ink.	"...Během celé mé kariéry — od prvních, nejjednodušších kouzel až po nejsložitější arkánní práce — jsem sledoval jediný cíl: nesmrtelnost. Po prostudování řady všeobecně známých metod jsem dospěl k závěru, že si budu muset vymyslet vlastní. Nechci se stát ghúlem; živoření v umělém těle mě též neláká; a reinkarnace sebou nese riziko, že nakonec uvíznu v těle žáby či myši.

For the first time in recent weeks, I found a few spare minutes to write a message for you, friends, and family. Your restless brother Berenguer is not dead and gone. Quite the opposite, I'm alive and glad for this chance I've gotten. By joining the crusader ranks, I've truly found my place for the very first time, can you imagine?
I can already hear your disapproving retort: 'Berenguer, that scoundrel, he now thinks himself a hero!' But believe it or not, these days my intentions are further from any esteemed titles or glory than ever before. I joined the crusaders out of boredom, out of horrible melancholy that clouded my mind and filled it with dark thoughts. But for some reason, a slacker and a drunk such as I, who has done nothing worthwhile in his whole life — happened to gain the favor of the resplendent Iomedae. On the fifteenth day of battle, surrounded by her loyal devotees, stained up to my elbows in demon blood, I gave in to my comrades' influence and offered a prayer to the Inheritor — and my prayers were answered! From that day onward, I was not just a crusader — I was a paladin of Iomedae, able to smite Abyssal monsters with the power lent to me by the divine.
Will you even recognize me, Shynn, should I return home? I've changed, I can feel it myself. Iomedae gave my life purpose, offered me a weapon to slay the enemies of Golarion. By the Inheritor's name, I won't betray her trust!
Please, send my heartfelt regards to our poor mother and show her this letter. Visit father's grave for me, and never forget about me.
They're sounding the horns again — demons spotted. Be well, Shynn! May Iomedae's blessing be with you!

Many of them, exhausted from their long travels or just unable to find acceptance among local residents, stayed outside already existing settlements. These communities remain to this day, and they all share a certain curious tradition.
This celebration was seemingly established at the same time in all Sarkorian enclaves, even in the most distant ones. The event bears several names: Night of the Witch, Vorlesh's Verdict, Bonfire Night — among others. The preparations begin several days in advance. The adults craft an enormous effigy of the most hated servant of the Abyss — the witch Areelu Vorlesh, who opened the tear between two planes and thus earned the titles 'Architect of the Worldwound' and 'Betrayer of Humanity.' The children, who are usually relieved from their chores, gather kindling in the nearby forest. Instead, they might ask their neighbors for some wood, traditionally voicing their request in the form of concern: they need something to 'warm the witch's feet.' On the appointed day, the crowd places the effigy on a pole in the center of the settlement or neighborhood, where everyone can throw mud at it until sunset. At nightfall, cheers erupt as Areelu Vorlesh's effigy burns to ash. It's worth noting that effigy incineration is so akin to an atrocious method of execution that guards and other enforcers often observe these festivities with great suspicion. However, any claims of the Sarkorians burning those suspected of demon worship in the place of an effigy are idle flights of fancy, lacking substance."

The commanding officer, who wasn't prepared for this sudden barrage, gasped for air in righteous indignation for the first few minutes, then, once his lungs were finally full again, barked with such force that all fell silent. In the ensuing quiet, Brim took the initiative and reported hastily,
'Sir, Private Brim reports — we've caught an abrikandilu!'
The stern quartermaster, having caught the scoundrel responsible for the chaos red-handed, was about to express his outrage, but it was too late; as soon as he heard about the captured demon, the officer demanded to see the quarry immediately. The retinue, joined by the officer, his guards, secretary, courier, and a groom who happened to be passing by, advanced to the outskirts, where the recent events had taken place.
Upon seeing the huge demon thrashing about in his magical cage, the officer couldn't help but exclaim in delight. Except, the spiteful quartermaster then pushed his way through the crowd after all and nasally whined in the officer's ear, 'Sir, just look at what cost these buffoons caught one lousy demon!' The officer took his eyes off the abrikandilu, looked around — and threw his hands up.
'What's all this, Private Brim?'
'Sir, what do you mean?'
'What's this massive pit?'
'That was our first trap! The abrikandilu was to supposed to drop down once he'd seen the bait! Took a lot of effort, this pit. We broke two shovels, all for naught...'
'And why are the shrubs smoking?'
'Ah, once the abrikandilu'd figured us out, he chased us around, throwing his magic all over the place!'
'And why is the tree broken?'
'Because that jerk tried to pull me down from it after I'd climbed up with a lute!'
'Hold on, why would you climb it with a lute?'
'Well, first of all, I was bait — I played some marches to provoke the abrikandilu's hatred for all things of beauty. And second, I was running from a demon, and I couldn't leave the lute — I'd borrowed it from the bard in our regiment, and he packs a good punch, that one!'
The officer frowned, ignoring the quartermaster's snivels.
'Right,' he exhaled at last. 'Dispose of the demon. Private Brim is to be rewarded. All the equipment lost by him and his mates is to be deducted from his pay.

107388	A notice in large letters on the book's binding reads: "This book is banned within the borders of Mendev."
"Taken from the account of a noble Mendevian warrior, veteran of two crusades, who was grievously wounded and is currently receiving treatment in a hospital in Andoran.
The First Crusade, intended to purge the lands of Sarkoris of the demon scourge, was called up in 4622. The loss of Aroden was still a raw wound in the hearts of the faithful, and those who answered the call of the Church of Iomedae channeled their grief and fury toward a new cause — the defense of Mendev and the liberation of Kellid lands from the spawn of the Abyss who at that time were reveling in the ruins of Sarkoris.
Many answered the call of the Inheritor's followers and fought under the banners of the crusaders. Illustrious warriors ventured forth into the lands captured by the demon pestilence, bringing with them cleansing fire and long-absent hope. Ere long the filthy hordes were driven out of the western reaches of Mendev into the Sarkorian Steppe, and beyond as far as the Threshold fortress, which to this day remains the beating heart of the Worldwound. In 4630, having pursued the demons beyond the Northmounds of Sarkoris and secured the borders, the Church of Iomedae declared the First Crusade complete.
But alas, what the valiant liberators thought was the closing chapter to a victorious campaign was but the prelude to a tragedy that is unfolding today before our very eyes. Two years ago, an endless wave of demons poured forth from the Northmounds into the Kellids' plains. The fortresses that had so recently stood strong on Mendev's borders were washed away in this unstoppable flood. The Second Crusade was called up without delay, but it was too late: the source of the corruption, the Worldwound, opened its putrid maw wider to disgorge not scattered hordes, but full-fledged armies led by monstrous generals.
The Second Crusade goes on, but the morale of Golarion's defenders is at its lowest ebb. Neither the Church of Iomedae nor the courageous crusaders have the power to overcome the demons that have now overrun Sarkoris. There will be no turning point in this war: all we can do now is wait for death on the borders of Mendev, which has not yet bowed down before the hordes of the Abyss, and pray to the gods that the Worldwound does not expand yet again, delivering new horrors into our world."

"Remember, crusader, your foes are many, and each one is devious in its own way. In the lands of the Worldwound, two demonic masters rule; learn to distinguish their influence and their followers.
Deskari is a demon lord who commands locusts and other crawling pests. It is an all-devouring wave that sweeps away all that is bright, majestic, and pure, leaving behind nothing but decay and ashes. For a hundred years, this evil fiend and his lackeys have been sowing death and suffering all across Golarion, sending one horde after another through the Worldwound and onto our plane. Deskari's visage is hideous, for his essence is a horrid crossbreed of humanoid and insect, and behind his back are fluttering wings woven from swarms of insects. Born of two demons, Deskari despises both his brethren that were once mortal and his own human followers. Knowing of this disdain, the cleverest of his cultists seek ways to transform themselves into full-blooded demons, and to this end, they attempt some of the vilest experiments on their own flesh.
Deskari has been behind the horrors of the Worldwound ever since its creation. However, the other demon lord, Baphomet, joined him only at the onset of the Third Crusade. The goat-headed demon lord is cunning and slippery, and where his unholy kin makes his way through brute force, Baphomet prefers deceit, corruption, and backstabbing. Many noble houses trying to preserve their veneer of exalted dynasties keep to the worship of Baphomet as a family tradition. In truth, the cultists who call themselves 'templars of the Ivory Labyrinth' are searching day and night for weaknesses in the crusader ranks — a doubtful mind to corrupt, a wavering heart to break, an ember of cowardice to fan. Beware of the cultists of Baphomet, for they might be standing next to you, looking over your shoulder and laughing at what you are reading."

"I spit on the streets of Kenabres. I spit on its granite walls and its stained glass windows. If tomorrow the ground trembles, splits apart, and devours this cursed city, I will not shed one tear. No one here, not a single soul, deserves any compassion. Everyone who lives in this city is a criminal! If there were any justice in this world, every one of them would be hanging from the gallows, Prelate Hulrun and Queen Galfrey chief among them!
Ask anyone on the streets what they know of mongrels. The answer will be dumb silence, or the lowered eyes of a scoundrel who knows their crimes but doesn't want to think about it. 'Mongrels!' A disgusting nickname, which the residents of the city have given to the brave crusader heroes who defeated the forces of evil, but paid for it with their health. Covered with scabs and tumors, bloated and gnarled, they were no longer beautiful enough to be tolerated by the very people they'd saved. As a reward for their heroism, the city dwellers exiled them to the sewers and damp caves beneath the city! The author of these words went down there and spoke with them — and I'll have you know that the ugliest of them is more noble than all the paladins of Mendev, not to mention that head-chopping Prelate and his murderous Queen!
And if any pretend that today's city dwellers aren't responsible for the crime of their grandfathers, then I will spit in their face, for the grandchildren of the exiled are still down there, crawling in the mud and eating garbage. And everyone who knows about this and does nothing, and everyone who should know but prefers blissful ignorance — I say they're all guilty and they repeat the same crime every day!
And as long as this doesn't change, any citizen who desires to fight a demon should take a knife and stab themselves in the stomach. For your city has already rotted, and you are no better than the demons! And if anyone would repent and right this terrible wrong, they should turn their weapons on the prudish paladins who preach good but defend an order that flies in the face of justice!

107406	A story recorded by Tullius Marah, from the words of Woren, a peasant from the village of Darkfords
"Want to know why they call old Genty 'The Crusader'? This is what happened. Ogar the farmer died, leaving three sons. The two older ones divided the land and lived their lives, and Genty, the youngest one, was a square peg in a round hole, as they say; he only knew how to bask under a tree and eat pies. What was he to do? Where could he apply himself? So he got a rusty old sword from the blacksmith's back yard, mounted his skinny horse, and rode off, over the hills and far away.
Sooner or later, he came to a castle. Inside it, there was a knight's wife, sitting around waiting for her husband to return from the crusades. So our Genty sat down next to her, saying, 'Fair Lady, your husband is a great man, and you deserve all compassion. I am a crusader myself, and used to fight the horrible spawn of the Worldwound...' and so on he rambled. He sat behind the stone walls for a month, gained ten pounds, became even more well-groomed, and in the end looked like a baron! But he grew bored of the knight's wife: she was always pale and sad, and cried for days, praying to Sarenrae. So Genty waved her goodbye and went on his way.
He rode and rode, and saw a mill on a river, and a miller's wife — rosy cheeks, plump as a partridge. Our Genty cozied up to her, saying, 'Lady miller's wife, does your husband happen to be at home?'
'No, my good sir, last year the fey dragged him into the river,' she said.
So Genty invited himself to stay at the mill. He lay on a soft bed, eating pies, drinking beer, and walking around the village. He had some nerve: told everyone at the village tavern what a seasoned crusader he was. He feared no demon, and promised to show them what's what!
So one moonlit night, when he was huffing and puffing on the widow, he felt her grabbing his back so strongly that he couldn't stand it. He looked down, and there she was... a crone, horrible, like a skeleton, with a crooked nose, eyes like embers, a hollow stomach, ribs sticking out, and claws instead of nails, stinking of a ripened grave. Try as he might, Genty couldn't get away. The crone held him tight, hissing, 'Where are you going, my sweet crusader. Come on, put your bun in my oven!' And she stuck out her long tongue, and licked her rotten teeth.
Somehow Genty wiggled away, leaving plenty of his skin and meat on her claws. He ran from the mill in a panic! Ran all the way to the village, naked and bleeding. So, he's running and yelling, 'Demons! Demons!' Well, the locals gathered with their axes and pitchforks, and came to the mill — but it was empty. The crone was gone. They did find an ugly corpse in the basement, though. They knew it was the miller's wife, by her hair and clothes. That's when Genty lost his mind. Now he sits under his brother's windows, staring into the distance, saying, 'The demons are coming, the demons are coming.' That's the only thing he'll say."	Příběh zapsaný Tulliem Marahem, podle slov Worena, sedláka z vesnice Darkfords: "Chceš vědět, proč starého Gentyho říkají 'Křižák'? Stalo se to takhle. Ogar, sedlák, zemřel a zanechal tři syny. Ti dva starší si rozdělili půdu a žili si svým, a Genty, nejmladší, byl jak kulatý kolík do kulaté díry — jak se říká; uměl jen polehávat pod stromem a jíst koláče. Co měl dělat? Kde se uplatnit? Tak si vzal rezavý meč z kovářovy zadní zahrady, sedl na hubeného koníka a odjel, přes kopce a daleko pryč.	too_short:0.17

{br}"The Spinner of Nightmares let out a fiendish laugh, and the wind rose up, sending the sound rippling across the roof of the cavernous temple and off into the darkening sky.
'You cannot protect them!' The demon worshiper performed a graceful pirouette, as though she were mocking the ungainly venture-captain, who was slowly picking his way across the slippery roof tiles. 'You may have saved Anthoclitus today, but you won't save everyone who gets in my way! I will always be one step ahead, plunging a dagger into the heart of the next fool and sullying your path with blood that you will never be able to wipe clean!'
Hilor lost his footing once again and only by a miracle did he not go plummeting to his death. His heart threatened to beat right out of his chest, but his mind was consumed with the feverish awareness of how close he was to his target. Only a few dozen paces separated him from the Spinner of Nightmares — close enough to shoot, but the venture-captain wanted to be sure the bolt wouldn't kill her, merely maim and immobilize her. The hand crossbow that Hilor concealed under the folds of his cloak was throwing off his balance.
'The jig's up, the Spinner of Nightmares.' The venture-captain leaned forward as though trying to catch his breath — a diversionary tactic designed to weaken the vigilance of the villain, who seemed to be waiting for something on the peak of the roof. 'You have one chance to save your pathetic life — surrender now!'
The Spinner of Nightmares froze, as if considering the captain's words, before lunging forward like a snake and spitting with contempt:
'You will never see her again!'
Click, twang, the whistle of the bolt released from its cradle — and the swish of the Spinner of Nightmares's cloak as she dodged the shot, laughing. Hilor let out a bellow, pouring all his hatred and despair into the shout, dashed forward, and, slipping on the roof, tumbled to his knees. Gripping a jagged roof tile with his last remaining strength, the venture-captain swallowed a grunt of pain and raised his head — only to watch his daughter's abductor be swept away on a black wind.
'I will find you, the Spinner of Nightmares!' Hilor's shout seemed to carry far and wide across the whole of Mendev. 'I'll find you and I'll tear out your duplicitous heart!'"	{br}"Pletačka nočních můr vypustila ďábelský smích a vítr povstal, nesouc ten zvuk přes střechu rozlehlého chrámu a dál do stmívající se oblohy.	too_short:0.06

{br}"The skeptical ranger followed Hilor, who skirted the glade and cautiously surveyed the forest around them.
'If you're hoping to find someone here, Captain, you're wasting your time. The Needleglens are totally uninhabited. A wild animal might stray into these parts, but there are no people here.'
'Tell me,' began the venture-captain, drawing out the words, 'what is the secret to this place? The Worldwound is a stone's throw away, but the Needleglens look like an ordinary, healthy forest. No bubbling mold on the ground, no trees that are identical down to the last leaf, no trace of demons whatsoever.'
The ranger answered after a long pause.
'I don't know for sure, Captain. But people have different theories. Some say that the Needleglens are cursed by forces that came to this world before the demons — horrible creatures that could addle your mind with a single look. People say that's why the demons avoid this place — they're afraid.'
Hilor scoffed. His guide's tale was surely nothing but a cock-and-bull story, but the idea — of his quarry hiding at the very heart of a place thought to pose a dire threat to her — well, he couldn't help being tickled by that. The Spinner of Nightmares's trail led here, to this strange wood, there was no doubt about that. But how did she ever find the way here?
Hilor fished his tracker's monocle out from the depths of his pack, clipped it on his nose, looked up — and let out a full-bellied laugh.
'I can't fault the harridan for her ingenuity, but she might've changed up her nasty tricks, knowing the arsenal I carry. Follow me!'
The ranger scoffed in disbelief. The forest remained as much a mystery to him as before, but Hilor's gaze, directed as it was through the Eye of Truth, effortlessly picked out the magical notches on the tree trunks, leading to an as yet unknown destination."	{br}"Skeptický stopař následoval Hilora, jenž obtáčel mýtinu a opatrně přeměřoval les kolem nich.	too_short:0.05

{br}"The priestess bared her teeth, eerily white against the red of her blood-soaked face. The venture-captain took the sword in his other hand and slowly backed away, shielding a nearby crying elf with his body.
'We're going to die here,' muttered this former captive between sobs. 'I see no way out. The goddess has forsaken us!'
Hilor took his eyes off the priestess for a moment to glance around. That was all the demon worshiper needed to spew out a curse, jump up, and lunge at him with her corrupted dagger, aiming for his chest. Hilor parried the strike and immediately countered, but the flashing steel barely left a scratch on the enemy's thigh.
The temple around them was burning. The other cultists had long since fled, driven by fear, but Hilor and the sorceress's last escape route had been cut off by the possessed priestess. The venture-captain waved his hand, clearing the smoke in front of him, and saw their path to salvation.
'The aqueduct!' barked Hilor. 'Right above us!'
Still smearing tears and soot all over her face between sobs, the elf raised her head. Closed troughs ran at ceiling level — mountain river branches that supplied the putrescent gardens of Cyth-V'sug with life-giving moisture.
'We have to puncture it!'
The elven sorceress only hesitated for a moment, then threw up her hands, still dangling bits of rope from them. A magical surge cut through the smoke and sunk into the stone, leaving behind a glowing trail. At first, the water spattered out only in a thin stream, and Hilor thought their plan had failed. But a moment later, the stonework gave, and clear, roaring waters rushed from the rupture, sweeping away the smoldering rafters, pieces of roofing, and the shrieking, horrified priestess.
Chased by the wild torrent, Hilor took cover behind the altar, after pushing the elf to safety first.
'We're down two problems and up one. We won't be sacrificed, and it's unlikely that we'll burn alive,' — mused the venture-captain, sheathing his sword. 'Now we just need to figure out how to avoid drowning.'
The elven sorceress looked at the rapidly rising water. Her lips quivered.

"...the middle of the plateau that forms Central Sarkoris was the location of the region's capital — the city of Iz, the country's metallurgical 'heart.' The rich mineral deposits of these lands had been known to the Kellids since ancient times, and over the long centuries, plenty of mines and workshops had sprung up here, and their output flowed into Iz. From here, traders led their heavily loaded caravans to other parts of Sarkoris and beyond.
Many a wonder crafted by the Kellids over the years of their capital's prosperity disappeared without a trace with the demonic invasion and Iz's destruction. Local artisans were most skillful in their trade, which can be seen through the few surviving works of weapon smithing, jewelry making, and metal casting arts. And while silver headdresses with ornate temple rings and lightweight sabers with hilts bearing their owners' initials can still be found in museums and private collections, other handcrafted examples of Iz's legacy are lost forever. Specifically, we, of course, only know of architectural landmarks of both secular and sacred variety through scarce descriptions.

That was when the heart of Sarkoris was torn open by a crack between worlds, the Worldwound, which later spread out to consume the country in its entirety. Mendev was destined to become the foremost protector of our world against the demon hordes. Its illustrious queen bolstered her ranks with warriors flocking to Mendev from all over Golarion, servants of Aroden who were determined to preserve their faith in this dark hour, and followers of a different, new goddess, Iomedae. Her armies faced the demonspawn and drove them back, away from Mendev's borders. And thus, the crusades were born, blessed by Iomedae and led by Galfrey, who now gained the Inheritor's favor."

An illustrious paladin and a shrewd leader, Galfrey rules over her subjects with dignity and grace to this day.	too_short:0.38

"Frowning, Lord Trezbot made a gesture for his people to halt. Everyone froze; no one dared to disobey his order, even one given with his eyes alone. Lord Trezbot loved to say that he could only win when his whip frightened his soldiers more than the demons' claws — and he succeeded like no other in enforcing discipline.
The lord approached what we took for a scarecrow from afar, left in the middle of the wasteland by an unknown farmer. Pricking it with his sword, the lord made us a sign to approach. It was the body of a young crusader — a boy, not twenty years old. Horribly broken, disemboweled, with shards of bone sticking out and shreds of skin dangling in the wind. Horror watched us from the stake, eye sockets filled with worms.
A contemptuous smirk crossed the lord's face. 'Coward.' He said through his teeth. 'Fled from the battle. The demons caught him and he surrendered without a fight. And here are his useless fellows!'
The lord kicked an inconspicuous bump under his feet, and it rolled, revealing an open helmet's visor with greenish-gray mush inside, swarming with insects. We shivered and looked down, realizing the ground underneath our feet was a mix of shards of metal and pieces of flesh.
'Cowards.' The lord said again. 'Cowards and weaklings. They were doomed even before they approached the Worldwound. They should never have left their comfortable homes. What did they achieve? They delivered the demons a hot lunch, that's all. Let's go! While the slugs waste their useless lives, someone has to win this ridiculous war!'
Without turning away, or heeding the disgusting crunching sound underneath his feet, he strode forward. We hurried after him, trying not to step on anything that was until recently a part of a someone's body."	By Nurah Dendiwhar	too_short:0.01

"A troop brought news from the west. The plains have fallen: the clans have been slaughtered and the beasts are feasting on the slain warriors. A few survivors were found, but attempts to get them to the fortress failed. Our own warriors fought their way back with difficulty — the outlying fortifications are overrun with the scum. Only reinforcements from the east will have any chance of breaking through this noose that is slowly closing around our neck — all we can do is wait…"
"…they attacked from the sky. The tower is still standing, but burnt out. Along with Zonak and the others. There was no time to light the funeral pyres — we scooped up the bodies and tossed them back behind the walls before we were caught by another wave. Rolug's squad were stationed at the deserted post — most of them have been maimed, so they're not much use on the walls…"
"…they vanished into thin air. The smoke makes day and night bleed into one and watching the eastern horizon is getting more and more difficult. The hope of seeing the banners of Mendev has kept the dread of death at bay for some — without this comfort, yesterday's warriors turn into whimpering curs. The beasts lose their last grain of fear in the dark — one of the sentries was plucked right off the wall in front of five of his fellows…"
"…half of the left tower is sinking into the opening fracture. We barricaded the doors, but the smoke pouring through the hole took down three of us…"
"...he was spitting, guffawing, lambasting the foreign traitors and screaming that the Mendevians weren't coming. Yuno smashed the lunatic's skull in…"
"...our days are numbered. The smoke makes breathing all but impossible — we sit out the time between attacks in the cellars, where at least there's some fresh moisture that trickles down the walls. Our sentries are disappearing one after another — suffocating in the smoke or snatched up by the claws of some flying beast…"
"…we will open the gates in an hour. Let those who trace our final days see that the last sons of Sarkoris died standing tall…"
One more page is glued in among the final sheets. The page is made from finer paper and is emblazoned with an inscription in ornate lettering.
"I discovered this journal in the fortress's underground refuge soon after clearing the place of demons. The defenders of the Greengates met their deaths with honor. We could not save you, but your courage stands as an example to every person who picks up a weapon today in the name of Golarion. I vow that our newly formed Crusade, which already proceeds apace through these mutilated lands, will finish what the Sarkorians started — just as I have finished this journal. The banners of the dead will fly under clear skies once more!"	Vazba deníku je spálená a mnoho stran chybí. Ty, jež zbyly, jsou pokryty špínou a plísní.

107443	"Years later, into the mountain valley, which for many years had lain uninhabited and had fallen into a state of desolation, rode the prideful Rider. His steed was wild and fleet, his tall steppe helm shone like a gilded mask, and his sharply curved bow could strike from thrice-times three hundred paces away. Dauntlessly did the Rider ride into the remains of the settlement and, drawing up beside the stone pillars into which were carved the images of the ancestors, he bowed low before them, and then he sliced open his palm and blooded those same stones. Then the Rider unbridled his mount and sent him off, for his loyal companion would be of no use to him in the cramped caves. The Rider checked his bowstring, descended into the depths, sat down in the largest of the caves, and waited.
Soon the Pack appeared — they were hungry, wasted, and as such even more vicious, for it had been long since they had eaten the human flesh they so favored. But the Rider pulled his bowstring tight and let fly arrow after arrow. The darkness was no obstacle, as he used sound to guide his arm, until each down to the very last was stuck full. Perishing, the last of the Pack creatures opened its maw and in the Follower's voice asked, "Who are you, mighty Rider, who does not fear to tread here and end my cursed and rotten life? Tell me your name, my lord, and tell me from what noble clan do you hail." The Rider removed his tall helm with its gilded mask, and long braids tumbled free from beneath it. It was no man, but the Daughter of the wise Patriarch, who on the brink of death made her swear one final vow — a vow of vengeance. For years she had roamed, bearing in her heart cold malice and righteous fury for all sorcerers and their ilk. For years her arrows had cut down despicable sorcerers, while her conviction had only grown in strength and certainty. And at last the hour had come for her to return and avenge the clan whose name has now been condemned to obscurity. She did not answer the dying monster, for vile sorcerers are undeserving of even a word from a worthy person's lips. She burned the Pack's stinking bodies, left the caves, bowed before the ancestors one last time, and departed, never again to return."	"Roky poté do horského údolí, jež dlouho leželo neosídlené a upadlo v pustotu, přijel pyšný Rider. Jeho kůň byl divoký a mrštný, vysoký stepní přilbík mu zářil jako pozlacená maska a jeho ostře zahnutý luk zasahoval z devíti set sáhů. Nepolevujíc v odhodlání Rider vjel do pozůstatků sídliště a, když zastavil u kamenných sloupů s vytesanými obrazy předků, hluboce se jim poklonil, poté si pořezal dlaň a potřísnil těmi samými kameny krví. Poté pustil svého oře a poslal ho pryč, neb by mu v úzkých jeskyňských prostorách nebyl užitečný. Rider natáhl tetivu luku, sestoupil do hlubin, posadil se v největší z jeskyní a čekal.	too_short:0.28
107444	"In the western mountains there dwelled a clan whose name is no longer spoken today. They were a brave and hardy people who would go down into the deep caves and return laden with glittering ore. The clan flourished: it had all things in abundance, including food and honey, because their neighbors gladly bought the things they forged from the underground ore.
Trouble came to the clan on the last day of Calistril, when the mountain passes were ready to shake off winter's icy grip, like hounds waking from a long sleep. Clamor and clouds of dust rose up from the caves that night. Once the dust had settled, the miners went down to look, for they were brave people who feared neither darkness nor falling rocks. But what they found was not darkness or a cave-in. What they found was the Pack.
The Follower, whose true name had been forgotten generations before, was of clan blood. The Follower was a despicable sorcerer, a degenerate who had turned his back on his ancestors. He had loved the Daughter of the wise clan Patriarch most ardently, but her heart had held no warmth for him. The Follower had stormed into the dark depths of the caves, seething in his resentment, and with much wailing and berating, plotted his revenge. That is where the dread Pack found him, following the scent of profane magic and vice. The Pack devoured him, and in so doing, tasted human blood for the first time, and discovered it was to its liking.
The Pack killed the miners who descended into the caves, and thereafter it began venturing up the surface each night to devour one of the villagers before dragging the carcass back to the caves to gnaw on the bones. The wise Patriarch called the clan together in the long house and spoke, then the elders of the clan spoke, then the warriors, and then anyone could say their piece. The ancestors had revealed to the Patriarch that the clan was being punished by the gods for failing to recognize the degenerate sorcerer in their midst, and that no deity would intercede for them now. Lamenting their fate, the clan left their homes, the ancestors' carved images, and their temples to the gods, and fled. That caravan of grief made its way in silence, but not all the clan was represented among its number. Only women, children, and decrepit elders did it contain, for the strong men of the clan had remained behind. Many days they sat in the long house, sharpening their weapons and praying. Each night, one of the men would go down into the caves to satisfy the Pack's hunger with his own flesh. When all the men were dead and the Pack's hunger drove it to the surface, the caravan was already long gone, and the monsters could not pick up their trail.
The caravan traveled day and night without rest until it reached the steppe, the very edge of their known world, whence the peaks of their beloved mountains could no longer be seen. And there they settled, living threadbare, meager lives, because they did not know how to rear animals and live the nomadic life that required, and because they had no strong warriors among them. The clan quickly dwindled — the old died, and the young found husbands and wives in other clans and left to join new households. Years later, during one of the harsh steppe winters, the clan Patriarch fell sick and died in the arms of his Daughter, and no one could recall the location of that house where the clan had once resided in such freedom and dignity."
The final pages of the book have been roughly torn out.	"Na západních horách přebýval klan, jehož jméno dnes již není vyslovováno. Byl to statečný a houževnatý lid, který sestupoval do hlubokých jeskyň a vracel se naložený třpytivou rudou.

107448	"Experiment day one
Today I was able to catch a quasit. Irori be my witness, it wasn't easy, considering my humble physical condition. Luckily, it was a scrawny specimen, about seven pounds, with a wingspan of about two and one third feet. When it awoke, the quasit first tried to attack me, and then ruined my clothes with his caustic saliva.
Experiment day three
I have begun my linguistic research. My goal is to study the language of quasits. I'm quite convinced they have their own dialect. Through understanding their speech, I will be able to understand their way of thinking, and convince them to rebel against their lords' tyranny. A revolution will roll through the Abyss, and the powerless will rebel against their oppressors. I'm sure that Everbloom Milani will not refuse her patronage even to such creatures as these, if they would break their chains of slavery.
Unfortunately, progress is thus far insignificant. I've been able to catalog only two words, which I suspect must mean 'rend' and 'carrion'. The quasit formed both words quite vividly when commenting on my person.
While I was entering this record, the quasit managed to steal my watch and throw it into the chamber pot. Judging by his spiteful giggling, he's quite delighted about his little joke. And despite the naughty trick, I am somewhat glad. Jokes and pranks are a part of cognitive communication, which I fully intend to establish with the specimen. I grow more and more convinced that I made the right decision in leaving Absalom and Forae Logos, the so called Wise House. More like narrow-minded fools stuck in the past, under the sway of their ringleader, that chatterbox, the fool of fools, Jubilost Narthropple. They've never appreciated the progressive nature of my theories.
Experiment day four
Today the quasit almost bit my nose off while I fed him. In response, to my shame, I beat him with a wand. Such behavior toward a sentient being is unacceptable, and I repent deeply. I've also run out of meat. The specimen and I will have to make do with porridge and soup.
Experiment day six
It's been three days since the specimen switched to a vegetarian diet. At first the quasit refused to eat plant-based food, but then ate some cabbage soup and poked at the porridge with his claw. His face looked so tragic.
Experiment day seven
The specimen has completely lost all signs of aggression. At dawn I was awoken by his moaning. The quasit was rolled up in a ball in the corner, whimpering. Despite his dangerous appearance, it's quite impossible not to feel compassion toward the poor creature. I had to take prompt measures and give the specimen a laxative potion. The quasit now reacts to me with confusion and fear, but at least it's not suffering any more. His gastrointestinal tract must have reacted unhappily to the unfamiliar diet.
Experiment day ten
What a great day! The switch to a completely plant-based diet is complete! The theory that quasits can only eat meat and carrion has been disproven! My eternal opponent, Sir Jubilost, will just have to go drown himself in a river!
The quasit has became peaceful and easygoing. He no longer tries to eat my boots, or the feet inside them. The specimen's behavior has become gentle and friendly. He shows some interest in ball games and physical exercise. I have named him Pekker.
Today he initiated communication, and attempted to explain a new word to me. By all evidence, he was making up the word during the communication process, for there has never been such a word in the quasit language. The meaning, as I understand it, is 'safety, comfort, and calm'.
I see no further need to keep Pekker on his chain. This experiment has convinced me that the vicious and evil traits attributed to quasits are acquired habits, not natural or inherent to their nature. Over these days I really have grown fond of him. And by all evidence, Pekker likes me too. He's gotten used to napping on my knee while I'm writing my observations in my journal. Maybe someday this quasit will become my familiar.
The current stage of the Experiment is complete. Pekker and I are soon off to Absalom, to present our findings before the professors at Forae Logos and become a scientific sensation. On our way, we may make a small detour to Avistan, so that Pekker will have a chance to better adapt to civilization. I hope the little trickster enjoys the journey."

107450	Excerpt from the third report for the Pathfinder Society, 4604
"Any report regarding my visit to Central Sarkoris would be incomplete without a mention of the alarming practice that goes against any and all humane ideals — the persecution of mages. Local culture has an astounding way of combining reverence and devotion toward divine magic with disgust and fear toward its arcane counterparts. A Puluran astronomer is a respected position, yet mages that would be welcomed at any academy or school in Avistan are considered dangerous creatures that belong in one of the prison fortresses, such as the wicked Threshold.
Most of the locals clammed up at the mere sight of me, unwilling to deal with a stranger from the 'land of heretics.' I even had to run for my life once or twice, when overly vigilant residents summoned the guards on me. But there were those who took their chances by speaking with me, an elf from the 'mad lands where mages walk among other people like proper citizens.' These brave souls helped me grasp the reason for this unusual disposition toward spellcasters, as the motives behind these superstitions are quite valid. In the eyes of the Sarkorians, priests are those who follow the strict code of their god and receive divine powers in return. Mages and sorcerers, on the other hand, are freaks of nature, abominations whose arcane powers are not subject to anything save for their own feeble mind and treacherous will.
Of course, most of the enlightened Absalom residents, myself included, would find these beliefs barbaric and cruel. However, we have to take into account the complete lack of any schooling system for young spellcasters in Sarkoris. No one teaches the youth the basics of controlling their powers, the elementary incantation orthodoxy, or even any theory of moral obligations to themselves and others. It's no wonder that vulnerable young minds, having received powers of shocking proportions, often cross an unseen line and become monsters in the eyes of their own people.
Given this lamentable state of education and having seen for myself the consequences of a crazed mage roaming the outskirts of Iz, all I can do is confirm, with great regret, that the practice of imprisoning Sarkorian spellcasters bears the utmost pragmatic importance for this society."

Fragments of the past sometimes fall into the crusaders' hands, artifacts both sacred and profane that possess great power. By gathering experienced craftsmen in Drezen, the Commander can see these ancient treasures transformed into truly powerful objects.
