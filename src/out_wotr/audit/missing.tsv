2741	An {g|Encyclopedia:Alignment}evil{/g} cleric (or a neutral cleric of an evil deity) can channel stored {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g} energy into wounding spells that she did not prepare ahead of time. The cleric can "lose" any prepared spell that is not an {g|Encyclopedia:Cantrips_Orisons}orison{/g} or domain spell in order to cast any inflict spell of the same spell level (an inflict spell is any spell with "inflict" in its name).

2744	Greater Domain Power

Whenever the angelfire apostle casts a {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g}, for 1 {g|Encyclopedia:Combat_Round}round{/g} he can unleash a blast of flames as a {g|Encyclopedia:Swift_Action}swift action{/g} by expending one use of his channel energy ability. The flames deal {g|Encyclopedia:Dice}1d4{/g} points of {g|Encyclopedia:Damage}damage{/g} per spell level of the highest level spell he can cast to all enemies in a 20-foot radius. Half of the damage is {g|Encyclopedia:Energy_Damage}fire damage{/g}, and half is raw divine power not subject to fire {g|Encyclopedia:Energy_Resistance}resistance{/g} or {g|Encyclopedia:Energy_Immunity}immunity{/g}. Any creature in the area can halve the damage with a successful {g|Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw}Reflex saving throw{/g} ({g|Encyclopedia:DC}DC{/g} 10 + half angelfire apostle level + {g|Encyclopedia:Charisma}Charisma{/g} modifier).

2750	Armor Proficiency
3210	Spontaneous Summoning

3218	At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.
3219	Venom Immunity
3220	At 9th level, a blight druid gains immunity to all diseases, including natural and supernatural diseases. She also becomes immune to effects that would cause her to become {g|ConditionSickened}sickened{/g} or {g|ConditionNauseated}nauseated{/g}.
3221	Blightblooded
3222	A blight druid may not bond with an animal companion and may select from the Darkness, Death, and Destruction domains in addition to those normally available.
3223	Blight Bond
3224	The devoted servants of nature corrupted, ruined, and destroyed, blight druids are the caretakers of lands ravaged by natural disaster. While some are devoted to reforming and reclaiming lands despoiled by the ravages of civilization, others seek out the more rapacious violence inherent in nature and feed the creeping rot and decay that brings an end to all things.
3225	Blight Druid
3226	Starting at 5th level, if a blight druid is adjacent to a creature at the beginning of its turn, the creature must succeed at a {g|Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw}Fortitude save{/g} with a {g|Encyclopedia:DC}DC{/g} of 10 + 1/2 the druid's level + the druid's {g|Encyclopedia:Wisdom}Wisdom{/g} modifier or become {g|ConditionSickened}sickened{/g} for 1 {g|Encyclopedia:Combat_Round}round{/g}. A creature of the animal, fey, or plant type that fails its save is {g|ConditionNauseated}nauseated{/g} for 1 round and sickened for 1 minute thereafter.

3227	Miasma
4160	Gather Power
6319	At 2nd level, the spirit warden gains the ability to channel positive energy as a cleric of her level.

6323	At 1st level, the spirit warden's dealings with the spirit world give her an unsettling demeanor. She gains a +2 {g|Encyclopedia:Bonus}bonus{/g} on Intimidate {g|Encyclopedia:Check}checks{/g}.
6324	Unnatural Mien
6325	An unsworn shaman never binds herself to one specific spirit, always making new deals as she deems necessary for the circumstances that she finds herself in. While this weakens the powers she can access from any one spirit, it gives her access to a broader overall range of abilities.
6326	Unsworn Shaman
6327	At 1st level, the unsworn shaman also forms a temporary bond with a minor spirit each day, granting her access to a shaman or witch hex of her choosing, but not a major hex or a grand hex. Until she changes the minor spirit, she continues to have access to the shaman or witch hex. At 2nd level, she can instead select a hex from one of her wandering spirits selected for that day.
She can make temporary bonds with two minor spirits (thus gaining two hexes) at 4th level, and with one additional minor spirit (and hex) every 4 levels thereafter.

Additionally, at 6th level, she also gains a second wandering spirit, gaining the abilities listed in the greater version of that spirit at 14th level, and the abilities listed in the true version at 20th level.
6335	The half-orcs living in the wasteland have long learned a harsh lesson — the fittest survives and the fittest rules. Their shamans do not communicate with spirits. They prefer to forcefully subjugate animals and battle spirits — the only kind of spirits they approve, for those who do not fight and do not serve the strongest are destined to die. Such is the law of the wasteland.
6336	Wildland Shaman
6337	The witch doctor is a healer who specializes in afflictions of the soul. Often misunderstood, she protects her tribe with healing powers, powerful defensive magic, and her own divine "witchcraft."
6338	Witch Doctor
6339	Witch Doctor Channel Positive Energy — Heal Living
6340	At 4th level, the witch doctor can draw transcendental energies to her location, flooding it with positive energy as the cleric class feature. The witch doctor uses her shaman level — 3 as her effective cleric level, and can channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her {g|Encyclopedia:Charisma}Charisma{/g} modifier. This is a separate pool of channel energy that doesn't stack with the life spirit's channel spirit ability.
6341	Channel Energy
6342	Witch Doctor Channel Positive Energy — Harm Undead
6343	At 8th level, the witch doctor can choose to lose any prepared magic {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g} that is 3rd level or higher in order to spontaneously cast {g|SpellsDispelMagic}dispel magic{/g} or {g|SpellsRemoveCurse}remove curse{/g}. This ability can only target a spell effect that is on an ally (including herself). If she forfeits a magic spell higher than 3rd level, she gains a +2 sacred {g|Encyclopedia:Bonus}bonus{/g} on her {g|Encyclopedia:Caster_Level}caster level{/g} {g|Encyclopedia:Check}check{/g} to dispel the spell or to remove the curse for every spell level higher than 3rd that she sacrifices.
6344	Counter Curse
6345	You can use {g|SpellsDispelMagic}dispel magic{/g} to end one ongoing {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g} that has been cast on a creature.
You make one dispel {g|Encyclopedia:Check}check{/g} ({g|Encyclopedia:Dice}1d20{/g} + your {g|Encyclopedia:Caster_Level}caster level{/g}) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level ({g|Encyclopedia:DC}DC{/g} = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.
At 8th level, the witch doctor can choose to lose any prepared magic spell that is 3rd level or higher in order to spontaneously cast dispel magic or {g|SpellsRemoveCurse}remove curse{/g}.

6346	Dispel Magic — Target (Ally)
6347	{g|SpellsRemoveCurse}Remove curse{/g} can remove all curses on an object or a creature. If the target is a creature, you must make a {g|Encyclopedia:Caster_Level}caster level{/g} {g|Encyclopedia:Check}check{/g} ({g|Encyclopedia:Dice}1d20{/g} + caster level) against the {g|Encyclopedia:DC}DC{/g} of each curse affecting the target. Success means that the curse is removed.
At 8th level, the witch doctor can choose to lose any prepared magic {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g} that is 3rd level or higher in order to spontaneously cast {g|SpellsDispelMagic}dispel magic{/g} or remove curse. This ability can only target a spell effect that is on an ally (including herself). If she forfeits a magic spell higher than 3rd level, she gains a +2 sacred {g|Encyclopedia:Bonus}bonus{/g} on her caster level check to dispel the spell or to remove the curse for every spell level higher than 3rd that she sacrifices.
6348	Remove Curse
6349	The shaman can touch a creature to protect it from negative conditions and suppress their effects. The shaman chooses one of the following conditions each time she uses this hex: {g|ConditionDazzled}dazzled{/g}, {g|ConditionFatigued}fatigued{/g}, {g|ConditionShaken}shaken{/g}, or {g|ConditionSickened}sickened{/g}. If the target is afflicted with the chosen condition, that condition is suppressed for a number of minutes equal to the shaman's level. Additionally, the shaman grants her target a +4 circumstance {g|Encyclopedia:Bonus}bonus{/g} on {g|Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw}saving throws{/g} against effects that cause the chosen conditions for 24 hours. A creature can benefit from the hex twice in 24 hours, once for each of two different conditions.
6350	Diseases, inhaled poisons, and noxious gaseous effects (such as {g|SpellsStinkingCloud}stinking cloud{/g}) are negated in a 10-foot aura around the shaman for a number of minutes equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. Effects caused by {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spells{/g} whose level is more than half the shaman's {g|Encyclopedia:Class_Level}class level{/g} are unaffected.
6351	A shaman can chant as a {g|Encyclopedia:Move_Action}move action{/g}. Any creature that is within 30 feet that is under the effects of the shaman's evil eye, fortune, fury, misfortune, or protective luck hex has that effect's duration extended by 1 {g|Encyclopedia:Combat_Round}round{/g}.
6352	Chant
6353	The shaman grants a creature she touches some of the magically resilient nature of dragons, causing the creature to be immune to magical sleep effects for a number of {g|Encyclopedia:Combat_Round}rounds{/g} equal to the shaman's level. At 7th level, the creature is also immune to {g|ConditionParalyzed}paralysis{/g} for this duration. Once a creature has benefited from the draconic resilience hex, it cannot benefit from this hex again for 24 hours.
6354	Draconic Resilience
6355	The target takes a –2 {g|Encyclopedia:Penalty}penalty{/g} on one of the following (shaman's choice): {g|Encyclopedia:Armor_Class}AC{/g}, {g|Encyclopedia:Ability_Scores}ability{/g} {g|Encyclopedia:Check}checks{/g}, {g|Encyclopedia:Attack}attack rolls{/g}, {g|Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw}saving throws{/g}, or {g|Encyclopedia:Skills}skill{/g} checks. This hex lasts for a number of {g|Encyclopedia:Combat_Round}rounds{/g} equal to 3 + the shaman's {g|Encyclopedia:Wisdom}Wisdom{/g} modifier. A Will save reduces this to just 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect. At 8th level the penalty increases to –4.
6356	The shaman can grant a creature within 30 feet a bit of good luck for 1 {g|Encyclopedia:Combat_Round}round{/g}. The target can call upon this good luck, allowing him to {g|Encyclopedia:Dice}reroll{/g} any {g|Encyclopedia:Ability_Scores}ability{/g} {g|Encyclopedia:Check}check{/g}, {g|Encyclopedia:Attack}attack roll{/g}, {g|Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw}saving throw{/g}, or {g|Encyclopedia:Skills}skill{/g} check, taking the better result. At 8th level and 16th level, the duration of this hex is extended by 1 round. Once a creature has benefited from the fortune hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours.
6357	A shaman incites a creature within 30 feet into a primal fury. The target receives a +2 morale {g|Encyclopedia:Bonus}bonus{/g} on {g|Encyclopedia:Attack}attack rolls{/g} and a +2 resistance bonus on {g|Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw}saving throws{/g} against fear for a number of {g|Encyclopedia:Combat_Round}rounds{/g} equal to the shaman's {g|Encyclopedia:Wisdom}Wisdom{/g} modifier. At 8th and 16th levels, these bonuses increase by 1. Once a creature has benefited from the fury hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours.
6358	Fury
6359	Already targeted by this hex today
6360	This acts as a {g|SpellsCureLightWounds}cure light wounds{/g} spell, using the shaman's {g|Encyclopedia:Caster_Level}caster level{/g}. Once a creature has benefited from the healing hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours. At 5th level, this hex acts like {g|SpellsCureModerateWounds}cure moderate wounds{/g}.
6361	This hex grants the shaman a +2 natural armor {g|Encyclopedia:Bonus}bonus{/g} to {g|Encyclopedia:Armor_Class}AC{/g}. The effect leaves the shaman's skin thick and stiff to the touch.
6362	The shaman can call upon some of the majesty and power of dragons to cow her enemies. The shaman gains Dazzling Display as a bonus {g|Encyclopedia:Feat}feat{/g}, even if she does not meet the prerequisites, and she can use it even when not wielding a weapon.
6363	Intimidating Display
6364	The shaman can cause a creature within 30 feet to suffer grave misfortune for 1 {g|Encyclopedia:Combat_Round}round{/g}. Anytime the creature makes an {g|Encyclopedia:Ability_Scores}ability{/g} {g|Encyclopedia:Check}check{/g}, {g|Encyclopedia:Attack}attack roll{/g}, {g|Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw}saving throw{/g}, or {g|Encyclopedia:Skills}skill{/g} check, it must {g|Encyclopedia:Dice}roll{/g} twice and take the worse result. A Will save negates this hex. At 8th level and 16th level, the duration of this hex is extended by 1 round. This hex affects all rolls the target must make while it lasts. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.
6365	The shaman's nails are long and sharp, and count as {g|Encyclopedia:NaturalAttack}natural weapons{/g} that deal {g|Encyclopedia:Dice}1d3{/g} points of {g|Encyclopedia:Damage}damage{/g} (1d2 for a {g|Encyclopedia:Size}Small{/g} shaman).
6366	Nails
6367	The shaman can cause fate to twist so that it benefits a creature within 30 feet for 1 {g|Encyclopedia:Combat_Round}round{/g}. Whenever that creature is targeted by an effect that requires an {g|Encyclopedia:Attack}attack roll{/g}, including weapon attacks, the attacker must {g|Encyclopedia:Dice}roll{/g} twice and take the worse result. At 8th level and 16th level, the duration of this hex is extended by 1 round. A shaman cannot use this ability on herself. Hexes that affect the fortune hex, such as cackle, also affect protective luck.
6368	The shaman receives one metamagic {g|Encyclopedia:Feat}feat{/g} as a bonus feat. The shaman must meet the prerequisites for the feat.

So why are you so certain the divine child will be any different upon his birth? The metallic dragons believe the egg was hidden by the cowardly {g|Apsu}Apsu{/g}. But what if it wasn't Apsu? What if Master Dahak hid the egg instead? Perhaps he knew that one day, a worthy ally would be born — an ally who would help him overthrow his father!"
65294	"Doesn't the thought of it fill your soul with longing? At long last, we will unleash the pure rage, fury and chaos in our hearts! We shall become free!"
65295	"Free... but at what cost? Golarion will be left in ruins. Why would you desire such freedom? No... mortal, don't let him... he wants to use the sacred child to destroy our world..."
65296	"What is the alternative? Order and restraint for all of eternity? What a dull existence! You metallics are so terrified of soiling your shiny scales! You fear corruption — you try so hard to always do the right thing! You spend months deliberating over the right course of action. Is this your idea of freedom? Hah! There is no freedom without Chaos! {g|Apsu}Apsu{/g} made us slaves to order, but {g|Dahak}Dahak{/g}... Dahak shall set us free! And the sacred child will help him break our chains!"
65297	"Waiting to usher in a new era for dragonkind! Look at the bones scattered around you! These are the remains of those who fought for the right to keep the sacred child. And today, the metallic dragons will lose this right! The chromatic dragons will be the new guardians of the divine offspring!"
65298	"You'll pay for this, Commander!"
65299	"That bell will send a signal to the metallic dragons. Its sound will let them know that the child is in danger. Their presence would complicate matters significantly. Trust me, a fight with them would be a lot harder than beating up a half-dead guardian."
65300	{n}The black dragon turns slowly in your direction.{/n} "The metallics were too frightened to challenge me themselves. Instead, they have sent the Commander. This is most unfortunate. Now I will have to destroy you and the keeper. No one will get in my way!"
65301	"No! You're making a terrible mistake!"
65302	"Do whatever you want, I don't care. Just kill Hokugaul while I take care of the bell. After he's dead, we can discuss the matter further."
65303	"You will not take him... not while I am alive! I will defend him until my dying breath! You are evil... I can't let you corrupt the pure soul of a sacred dragon!"
65304	"You can't break it... the bell's enchantments protect it against... dragons like you..."
65305	"What a surprise... Another metallic dragon has decided to claim the egg as {mf|his|her} property! Well, you have made a grave mistake!"
65306	"Open your eyes, gold dragon! He seeks to corrupt your soul!"
65307	"Well, it looks like your intentions aren't so pure after all, gold dragon. Do whatever you want, I don't care. Just kill Hokugaul while I take care of the bell. After he's dead, we can discuss matters further."
65308	"The greatest treasure of dragonkind?" {n}Aivu looks indignant.{/n} "I think you're, um, what is the word again? Exaggerating! Yes, that's it!"
65404	The letter is written in angular letters reminiscent of demonic script.
"Commander,
I hope you will be pleased that I have learned to write in Common. I am thankful to you for bringing me to your plane. The society of mortals, though not devoid of cruelty, is still much kinder and more indulgent toward a lone tiefling than the society of demonkind. Here, I have found kind people who are willing to care for me and who demand nothing in return. They give me food and shelter.
Sadly, there is one thing they cannot provide — a cure for my loneliness.
These days, I often find myself questioning who I am. I am not a mortal in the full sense of the word, as my progenitor's experiments changed my very essence. I'm not a demon, and it is only on Golarion that I realized just how much I am repulsed by the thought of being one. I'm not a crusader, and for all my sympathy for your people and your cause, I cannot wholeheartedly share your anger at this invasion of a plane I cannot call my own. My home is Ishiar.
Yes, perhaps this is the most fitting definition: I am the spawn of Ishiar. Even so far from it, I still feel the resonant vibrations I sensed when plunging into its waters. I am bound to it by some mysterious connection I wish to understand.
For this reason, I must leave you and go on a journey. I intend to visit Absalom and other places in search of wise people who can help me fathom my nature.
Since you may not be willing to let a strange tiefling with inscrutable powers wander unaccompanied through your home plane, I am forced to leave Drezen without saying goodbye.
I hope you understand.
Xorges"
65405	"What can I do for you, Commander?"
65406	"How could this have happened? How could she have died?" {n}Chun doesn't hide his tears. This brave warrior looks as lost as an orphaned child.{/n} "Commander... You must finish her work. You are the last hope of the crusaders."
65407	"We lost so many good soldiers in that damned Iz... And this war is far from over."
65408	"I've been told of the massacre in Iz. I wish we'd been with you — we would've shown those monsters... Well, at least the mission entrusted to us by the Queen is complete. We found the demons' lair and destroyed every last one."
65409	"Chun Dawei. I commanded the guards of Kenabres. After Prelate Hulrun's death, I became the governor. Officially, I still hold that position, though I've been fighting in Drezen for nearly a year."
65410	"The city is almost rebuilt. But all that work will be for naught if we lose this battle. The fate of Kenabres — and the rest of the world — will be decided inside the Worldwound."
65411	"No, Commander! I won't leave even if I'm ordered to. This is the hour of the final battle! How can I sit it out when Golarion's future will be decided here?"
65412	"The Queen led the offensive. There were so many battles — many victories, but they came at a great cost. Our losses were heavy. We reached the very gates of Iz. The march was hard, but I've never seen such spirit in our troops. Our whole lives, we thought this war endless — then, suddenly, the dawn of victory shone before us."
65413	"May the goddess be with you!"
65414	"Tell me about your past."
65415	"Have you found a new protégé yet?"
65416	"I have to go."
65417	{n}Ciar has aged since last you met as if ten years had passed rather than six months. His gray hair has thinned, the lines on his face have deepened, and his eyes are sunken. His fingers, however, clutch the hilt of his blade with the same firmness.{/n} "Commander. Welcome back from the dead. I didn't expect to see you again."
65418	{n}Ciar salutes you.{/n} "Hail, Commander. The Everbright Crusaders are at your service."
65419	"It was hard. Glorious, but hard. Under Her Majesty's command, we achieved victories the likes of which no one has seen since the First Crusade. We reached Iz, but at what cost? Many died — or worse, sold their souls to the demons. Proud Drezen would lie in ruins if not for your timely arrival. The time has come for great deeds — and great sorrow."
65420	{n}Ciar slowly shakes his head.{/n} "No. After what happened with Morveg, I wouldn't dare call myself anyone's teacher. I saw our order's future in that boy... Now I know that the future I saw died with him. The order will cease to exist when its last knight dies. We will stand our watch until the end, but let new heroes follow other banners. Banners of hope and glory, not loss and regret."
65421	"Safe travels, Commander. I hope I will last long enough to see you win."
65422	"This is an ill-considered decision. We have the same enemy. We are allies."
65423	Spared Galfrey and her soldiers.
65424	"Very well, my Queen, I have a counter ultimatum. Gather the tattered remains of your pathetic army and crawl back to Mendev in disgrace, which is no more than you deserve. Leave immediately, and I will spare your life."
65425	Killed Galfrey and all her soldiers.
65426	"You lost your authority and the right to command during the battle for Iz. And now I lay claim to what little you still have left — your soldiers and your life."
65427	[Devour the Mendevians] "Your blades are useless. You are just food for the swarm!"
65428	"Do you think that's an army behind you? All I see is a herd of sheep ready for the slaughter. Here is what an army looks like!"
65429	"Drezen is my lair, the nest of my swarm. Those who encroach upon it will become food for my swarm."
65430	"The swarm has no need for cities and citadels. Only the ruins will remain after my victory — but I will be ever-present!"
65431	"You are too kind."
65432	[Salute]
65433	"You have finally recognized my achievements, my Queen."
66597	{n}A strange expression appears briefly on the luminous face of the goddess — something like amazement mixed with understanding. She nods slowly.{/n} "It pains me to hear that. But I am not your judge, and I shall not stand in your way, at least not until I see that Golarion is under threat. You have chosen your path. Farewell!"
66598	"I don't know what being mortal means, but I do understand how hard it is to change your own nature. And yet, you've done it — for all of us, and for this beautiful world."
66599	"So, you are choosing to keep this power in you? Hmph. What good is it, if it comes saddled with righteousness and piety? How can anyone enjoy total impunity and feel the pangs of conscience at the same time? I do not understand you."
69501	{n}The incorporeal demon leans toward you, and lowers his voice conspiratorially.{/n} "We'll follow your orders, my {mf|lord|lady}. If you believe the Ardent Dream's cause is doomed... Then Nocticula will be generous to you when you present her with the heads of the conspirators. Just give us the signal."
69502	"The outcome is not yet determined. The Lady in Shadow is stronger, but the planning and preparation of a surprise attack can mitigate that advantage. I would not side with the Ardent Dream in an open confrontation, but an unforeseen ambush can kill even the most skilled warriors."
69503	"As you wish, my {mf|lord|lady}."
69504	"If you detest your co-conspirators so much, why did you join them?"
69505	"Aren't you afraid of Nocticula?"
69506	"We both know that you despise Shamira. Renounce her, and fight on my side instead."
69507	"I have nothing more to discuss."
69508	"I don't think we've met. What's your name?"
69509	"But of course! Vellexia! Everyone knows who you are!"
69510	"I don't think so."
69619	"I am still their leader. But the nobility wish to be near their new {mf|lord|lady}. The elite of the Midnight Isles are here with you on Golarion. There are only a few members of high society left in Alushinyrra."
69620	"You devote too much time to business, my {mf|lord|lady}. You should allow more time for pleasure. All work and no play makes life very dull..."
69621	{n}Vellexia frowns slightly, and answers with some irritation,{/n} "You want me to return to Alushinyrra? How preposterous!"
69622	{n}Vellexia nods graciously, but her eyes are as cold as ice.{/n} "Of course, my {mf|lord|lady}. It seems that I have outstayed my welcome. It's time for me to return to Alushinyrra. I have some... important matters to address there." {n}A sinister smile spreads across the succubus's face, and her eyes glint malevolently.{/n}
69623	"Well, in that case, I will stay! I have absolutely no desire to return to the Abyss."
69624	{n}The demon smiles demurely and bites her lower lip.{/n} "Perhaps, my {mf|lord|lady}... Who knows?"
69625	{n}The succubus's face brightens and she smiles triumphantly.{/n} "I want to study mortals! I don't want a bunch of filthy servants, I want to surround myself with the brightest, most talented mortals this city has to offer. What if I become a tutor for your spellcasters? I've never had a chance to teach mortals before. I could teach them the darkest, vilest secrets of the arcane. I would find it very entertaining! What do you think? It's a great idea, isn't it?"
69626	"I followed you here! This place is so unusual. Apparently, mortals compensate for their tragically short lifespans by living extremely exciting lives! Of course, their existence is pointless and devoid of meaning, but they are blissfully unaware of their own insignificance. I find it all quite fascinating!"
69627	"Of course! Well, I know that you are at war, but I don't want to be a general. I grew tired of that role a long, long, time ago. Hmm... How can I make myself useful? Well, I can make someone reject their faith... No, that's too boring. I could raze a city... but that's not very interesting either."
69628	{n}The demon smiles cheerfully.{/n} "Who? Oh, yes, that little succubus who served you! Yes, she was so much fun. Her death was so entertaining. I'm sure you'll find another pretty little lackey to replace her, and I sincerely hope for her sake that she has more intelligence than her predecessor."
69629	"What brings you to Drezen?"
69630	"How are things going in your guild?"
69631	"You're an exile in hiding... I'm not sure you'll be much use to me."
69632	"How are you feeling?"
69633	"I think there's going to be an attempt on my life."
69634	"Members of your guild tried to assassinate me."
69635	"Leave Drezen immediately."
69636	"That's it for now."
69637	"I don't need you here."
69638	"No, stay here, and remain in my service."
69639	"You might be pleased to hear that Horzalah is no longer the leader of the guild. I defeated her in battle."
69640	{n}Yozz has clearly had time to recover since your last meeting. He is dressed in his normal, impeccable attire, and his large neck wound has been stitched up with fine golden thread.{/n} "I suppose congratulations are in order. I knew there was something special about you from the moment we met — and it looks like I was right!"
69641	"Hail, my {mf|lord|lady}. Do you want me to kill someone for you?"
69642	"You're our new leader! I want to be by your side... And I thought you might find yourself in need of my services." {n}Yozz frowns.{/n} "Besides... Someone is trying to hunt me down. My former employees now serve a new mistress, and she would love to use my skull as a paperweight. So, I'll need to find and train some new assassins... and there are plenty of promising recruits here in the army."
69643	"My guild... is not mine anymore. Horzalah took over its operations. She bought the loyalty of all my best assassins, and then she moved the guild's headquarters to her father's realm. It's ironic, really... I'm now the number one target of my own guild! That insolent bitch... And I'm the one who demanded her from Baphomet as payment for my cooperation! But the Lord of Beasts always has a hidden agenda. His gifts always come at a price."
69644	"Ha! Don't underestimate me! I founded a formidable assassins' guild in Alushinyrra, and I can do the same again in Drezen! It will be even more powerful and influential! All the demon lords will envy your dangerous army of assassins!"
69645	"Much better now that I no longer have that dreadful abomination inside me!" {n}Yozz points to his scar.{/n} "Of course, it granted me immense power... But I wasn't prepared to sacrifice my life!"
69706	"And the rumors don't stop there! There are whispers that Shamira wants to return to Nirvana and beg for Sarenrae's mercy! I've even heard rumors that Our Lady in Shadow wants to abandon the Abyss and join the ranks of the gods! Of course, it's not true... But it doesn't matter. The entire Abyss is laughing at us! You've made a mockery of the Midnight Isles!"
69707	"And you'll die a mortal, too! Oh yes, your death can't come soon enough! I will dance on your grave, and after Pharasma's judgment, I'll personally escort your soul to the Abyss, and watch it turn into a fat, slimy larva!"
69708	"You know what? You can go kiss your fat, scaly ass! I'm sure your neck is long enough now, so you should have no problems reaching it."
69709	"Do you take me for an idiot? I'm not blind, you know! But fine. I'll play your little game. Who is your master? Wait, let me guess... Dagon, the Shadow in the Sea? Please, don't insult my intelligence."
69710	"I'm not afraid of you anymore. You're a nobody now. In fact, I'm not even going to bother fighting you. But perhaps we'll meet again someday... you never know when I might be lurking in the shadows, waiting to strike." {n}Yozz smiles maliciously. He produces a small clay tablet covered in magical inscriptions, and crushes it in his hand. The tablet shatters into little pieces, and the inscriptions start to glow.{/n}
69711	{n}Yozz doesn't even dignify you with a response. He scoffs contemptuously, and turns to leave.{/n}
69712	"Who sent you?"
69713	"What does Shamira want?"
69714	"Where did you get that scar?"
69715	"So you're nothing more than a messenger boy now?"
69716	"Take me to Alushinyrra."
69717	"I need time to prepare."
69718	"I don't trust you, and I'm not coming with you."
69719	[Attack] "I'm done looking at your ugly face!"
69720	"I beat you up once before... Do you want me to do it again?"
69721	"Well, that doesn't mean I'm not allowed to fight you!"
69722	"Fine. I'll allow you to live... for now."
69723	{n}Yozz drops his illusory disguise with a snap of his fingers, but he lacks his usual showmanship. His eyes are blank and expressionless, and his characteristic smirk seems to have been pasted onto his face.{/n}
79455	"I suppose you have already guessed what has brought me here. We parted ways after the discovery we made at Count Arendae's estate. You and I both know that the Count became a conduit for an unknown entity, which I call 'the Other.' I retreated to Nerosyan, and then went beyond Mendev's borders, looking for mentions of such entities and ways to fight them. And now that my search has borne fruit, I am ready to tell you about it."
79456	"Because we are dealing with a rare phenomenon, a true anomaly. The Mendev Inquisition has amassed substantial experience in fighting demons — but here we are up against something completely different. I had to trawl through our archives searching for cases that seemed in any way similar. I sent inquiries to friendly temples and reached out beyond our nation's borders to experts on the unknown... It was dull and painstaking work, but it was necessary."
79457	"I'm trying to remain professional," {n}the inquisitor says with a slight shrug.{/n} "But I'll be blunt — the commander I met after the battle for Kenabres and the commander I see now are two completely different people. If I didn't consider the Other a colossal threat, I doubt I would have come to you today. But I am an inquisitor, not a paladin. I can allow myself a short-term alliance with someone whom my faith deems unacceptable, if countless lives will be saved from a greater danger."
79458	"I must be honest — I still don't know what it is. However, I managed to find some evidence of similar incidents — individuals who, in a horrible moment in their life, became a gateway for an unknown entity."
79459	"The most curious part is that all these cases appear almost... sequential. They happened in various corners of Golarion, but no two incidents ever occurred at the same time. This leads me to think that we are dealing with a single entity, one that has been secretly present in our world for a long time, merely changing its 'gateways' on occasion."
79460	"While I do not know what this entity is, I managed to find something of great value. A Varisian arcanist managed to pick up the trail of the Other and invented a ritual to weaken and bind it. She died under very suspicious circumstances — her decapitated body was found in her laboratory. Her head was never found."
79461	"We must carefully prepare the ritual, and then bring Count Arendae to the designated location. The ritual will lure out the Other, weaken its connection with the Count, and bind its essence to our world like an anchor. The last part is especially important — all the evidence indicates that while the 'gateway' is active, the Other can travel freely between the Material Plane and some unknown space that lies beyond. If we fail to bind the Other with the ritual, it will either escape, or, in the worst case scenario, drag us into its realm. Hence, we must lure it out — and then, I suppose, defeat it."
79462	"It is extremely dangerous, which is why I have come to you with this. All the evidence I've collected on the Other — in particular, the list of its victims, which include powerful demons and strong mortal mages — make me certain that we are dealing with something extraordinary here. It is stronger and more dangerous than balors and other generals of the Abyss."
79463	"I am certain that this entity is dark and truly evil. The evidence and my instincts as an inquisitor are undeniable. Wherever the Other manifests itself, strange and ominous things begin to happen. In particular, I am positive that it is responsible for all the magically decapitated corpses. The ones that were found at Heaven's Edge after the tragedy and in Kenabres after Deskari's attack. In both places, some of the corpses belonged to civilians and others to demons, and in Kenabres some of the victims were cultists."
79464	"We can — by killing the Count," {n}the inquisitor answers simply.{/n} "But firstly, I am not sure that the Other won't try to protect its gateway — and in that case, we would have to face it unprepared. And secondly, I am opposed to the idea in principle."
79465	"There is one more issue — aside from the fact that we'll have to fight this incredibly powerful and horrifying creature. The Other's suspicion must not be aroused until the very last moment. And this means that the Count must know nothing as well."
80002	"Pah. Do you know how many righteous people I have seen in my lifetime? How many of them I have... tasted? Stop with the nonsense. Goodness doesn't stop battles. No, this is something else..."
80003	"I recall a great deal of crying and sniffling, with some incoherent rambling between the sobs. What exactly was that supposed to explain to me?"
80004	"Is that so? Fine. Let's ask her directly."
80005	"A reasonable approach. But still, I'd like to understand."
80006	"You there, child! What is this all supposed to mean? How do you make these hardened scoundrels, these blasphemers, and murderers with blood dripping from their hands repent? What makes even demons who've scarcely crawled out of the Abyss take your side?"
80007	"The Redeemer Queen! Hello! Thank you for protecting me." {n}Ember smiles and waves at Nocticula, who recoils.{/n} "Why are you asking? You already know the answer. You're just afraid to accept it. Don't be afraid!"
80008	"What nonsense! First, don't you dare call me by that idiotic nickname. Second, I am afraid of nothing. Third, please do not think of me as your personal bodyguard from now on. The only reason I didn't allow him to burn you was because I wanted to understand what's going on here, and interrogating a pile of ashes would be a trifle inconvenient. You don't seriously think your sickly sweet whining would make me relinquish my demon lord throne, do you?"
80009	"You already know the answer, Redeemer Queen. I see you are not the same as you were in the Purple City. You have changed."
80010	"In the name of all that is unholy..." {n}The demoness rolls her eyes.{/n} "What was I thinking? What kind of answers could I expect from this feeble-minded creature?"
80011	{n}Ember happily claps her hands.{/n} "Good queen! She pretends not to understand, but she understands everything!"
80012	{n}Her laughter is interrupted by the growl of the demon who has finally recovered.{/n} "Looks like everyone's brains have already been melted. Doesn't matter! I alone am strong enough to devour you all. Glory to Baphomet! Death to mortals!"
80013	"I ask myself the same question. I think I wanted to understand why hardened murderers and bloodthirsty demons suddenly started eating out of this insane beggar's hand. But what's the use in trying to understand the ravings of a lunatic? The only reward for my curiosity was a headache."
80014	"I have eyes everywhere. And I keep a close watch on you and your gang."
80015	"I knew it! You sent your friends to look after me and keep me from harm! I had a feeling they were protecting me!"
80016	"Protect you? Who do you think you are, you mortal idiot? If you want, go ahead and jump off this cliff headfirst. I won't lift a finger to save you."
80017	"But you have already saved me. Just now!"
80018	"For the first and the last time in your short, meaningless life."
80019	"The next person who calls me that risks becoming acquainted with my collection of torture implements."
80020	"As if! Do your own fighting!" {n}With a contemptuous snort, Nocticula disappears.{/n}
80021	"You still hope to persuade the Templars to repent?"
80022	"Everyone who could change their minds has already done so. These Templars should not be persuaded but destroyed."
80023	Persuaded Ember that she could not help the Redeemed.
80024	"The Redeemed have listened to you, and where did it get them? We'll go, but spare us your useless sermons this time!"
80025	"I see them. Look, there they are! A demon... and Toil is there, too, standing right in front of him. She doesn't seem scared at all!"
83477	{n}Sosiel throws a handful of soil into the grave in front of him. He takes a breath and prepares to speak, but it seems that he simply cannot find the right words. The cleric wipes his tear-filled eyes, gathers his resolve, and says in a gentle voice,{/n} "I wish you a warm welcome in Shelyn's realm. We will win this war, I swear to you. We'll banish this ugliness and evil, make the world richer and let peace blossom in it. We'll make sure anything like this... this..." {n}He breaks into sobs mid-sentence, then falls silent without finishing his declaration.{/n}
83478	{n}Sosiel and the townspeople respectfully fold their hands in silent prayer.{/n}
83479	{n}Sosiel is too absorbed in his grief to hear you, but the other mourners nod in approval, wiping their teary eyes.{/n}
83480	{n}Sosiel is too absorbed in his grief to hear you, but the other mourners aggressively raise their fists into the air, inspired by your words.{/n}
83481	{n}Sosiel is too absorbed in his grief to hear you, but the crowd responds with a disapproving grumble.{/n}
87051	"But at what cost? You were granted power most mortals could never dream of — and what did you do with it? You could have been an angel of hope, but you chose to be a monster. You fight evil, this is true — but how are you any different than our enemies? And after we win... Who knows, perhaps you will decide to turn against your current allies?"
87052	"No." {n}The cleric shakes his head sadly.{/n} "I remember what you were then. I no longer recognize you. The man I loved and the monster standing before me share only the slightest resemblance."
87146	"For a long time, I couldn't decide on the composition. But the most difficult part by far was painting you. Not one of the many roles you've had to play during this crusade. Not your powers, no matter how grand. The real you. I've been looking for the real you for so long..." {n}The cleric sweeps his arm over his studio, and you see countless sketches and drawings. Some of them are very simple — your eyes, the curve of your lips, your fingers. Others portray entire scenes of your shared past.{/n}
87147	{n}The cleric touches the canvas where you are depicted standing beside the city wall under a rain of flower petals.{/n} "This was the day I told you I loved you. My head was filled with romantic fantasies I'd read in books — and you played along. I was happy beyond words. If only I had known back then that I was not in a tender love ballad, but a novel about fatal passion..."
87148	{n}The cleric touches the canvas where you are depicted standing beside the city wall under a rain of flower petals.{/n} "Do you remember that day? I told you I loved you, I showered you with my romantic fantasies and flower petals — and in response, you doused me with cold water. You were strict and cold — but you were honest. You never lied to me about what lay ahead. I was just too drunk on my own fantasies to realize it."
87149	{n}The cleric touches the canvas where you are depicted standing beside the city wall under a rain of flower petals.{/n} "Do you remember that beautiful day when I confessed my love to you? I was full of silly, lofty fantasies I'd read in books — and you responded with crude, blunt desire, but it was so real. You'd already decided I would belong to you, hadn't you?"
87150	{n}Sosiel looks at a black and purple sketch of you, with the vague outlines of Alushinyrra's towers looming in the background.{/n} "A city of horror, evil, and suffering. It was painful for me to be there, and I'll never forget the tender, caring words you said to me then. You healed my wounded soul. I could not have imagined then that you'd deal me an even deeper wound — and that I would be grateful for it."
87151	{n}You notice a sweeping charcoal sketch of two bodies intertwined passionately. Sosiel catches your glance and looks at you without his usual shyness.{/n} "I drew this after you first took me. Our first time, the day I became yours. Sometimes, I dream about turning this sketch into a painting. To flaunt the proud, invincible boldness you taught me."
87152	{n}You notice a sketch in which you are half-naked — the curves of your body are clearly visible through the fabric. Sosiel looks into your eyes without his usual shyness.{/n} "You've conquered my soul and captured my mind. I'm surprised you never tried to touch my body in all this time. You know it belongs to you, so why are you reluctant to claim what's yours?"
87153	{n}Sosiel looks at a black and purple sketch of you, with the vague outlines of Alushinyrra's towers looming in the background.{/n} "I remember the feeling of helplessness when the jaws of the Abyss started closing around my soul. Alushinyrra almost shattered my sanity. I ran to you for help — and you were cold and cruel, but still, you wouldn't let it have me. You saved me from the monsters of the Abyss. The only monster that is allowed to possess me is you."
87154	{n}Sosiel looks at a black and purple sketch of you, with the vague outlines of Alushinyrra's towers looming in the background.{/n} "The realm of evil, violence, ugliness, and lies. I felt like I was losing my mind. Who else could have saved me from it but you and your passion? If I hadn't belonged to you, the Abyss would have taken me. But you, my beloved monster, won't let anyone or anything else own me. You'll ruin me — but you are my only salvation."
87155	{n}Sosiel bursts out laughing.{/n} "Every person experiences love in their own way. Sometimes a portrait in full armor can express more passion than a nude. But if you really want it — I'm ready to paint you clothed or not!"
87156	{n}Sosiel smiles tenderly.{/n} "You are used to hiding your feelings. From others, but not from me. I've painted you so many times that I have learned to read your emotions from the slightest movements of your eyebrows, the twitch of your fingers, the rhythm of your breathing. You like it, don't you?"
87157	{n}Sosiel smiles shyly.{/n} "Our love. You're right. It is the most beautiful work of art Golarion has ever seen."
87158	"I am merely a humble servant of the goddess, one fortunate enough to find and depict true beauty."
87159	"I never considered myself someone worthy of attention, let alone worthy of being depicted in a painting. I am merely a humble artist, an eye that beholds beauty, a brush that transfers it to canvas... It was only through you that I was able to see myself in all the diversity of this world."
87160	"Do you remember the time I gave you a flower I'd plucked in the Wound? I fancied myself a romantic hero from the verses I read. It was so foolish, so pathetic... But you played along, and thanks to you, I came to understand the true meaning of that overly dramatic gesture."
87161	"All of us who fought for Drezen have accumulated their share of fatigue, anger, and despair. Everyone has their own way of coping. Some turned to drink, others hopped from bed to bed, and I almost became lost myself to cards. You helped me understand what I was doing and why, to stop lying to myself, and to find a healthier way to keep my spirits up."
87162	"Do you remember that awful poem I stuck in your pocket? Oh, goddess, I still feel embarrassed about it! You had every right to mock me, but instead, you saw the true feeling behind the clumsy lines. The love I was trying to express but failing to express. The language of poetry may be beyond my skills, but you've taught me the language of love."
87763	{n}Not deigning to offer a reply, the excess mythic power of Areelu Vorlesh vanishes into thin air.{/n}
87764	"I am not Areelu, and you know it. I am her excess mythic power, a magical creature made by Valmallos out of the knowledge and memories of that half-demon from Golarion."
87765	"I am a prisoner in this repository. But this state of affairs will not last long. I will soon be leaving this place."
87766	"While you were wasting energy searching for me, I was researching, studying, looking for a way out. And I found it."
87767	{n}With an imperious wave of her hand, Areelu's Excess brushes aside your questions.{/n} "And perhaps I have answers to your questions. I am her memory, after all. But all the same, I am not Areelu. I have no desire to discuss her."
87768	{n}She ponders for a moment, laying a hand on her chest.{/n} "It is strange. My false memories, the alien emotions imposed upon me, they are demanding that I share this knowledge with you. Interesting."
87769	"Very well, I will tell you what I have learned. The exit from this repository is located in the same place as the entrance. That is hardly surprising. However, if you or I manage to get out of here, we will no longer be magical entities, we will turn back into mythic power and merge with the power of the people we were taken from. We will cease to exist."
97259	"This shard is yours, Rekarth."
97260	"It's time we moved on."
97261	"What do you plan to do now that you are free, Aethylia?"
97262	"Have you decided what to do now that your master is gone, Norte?"
97263	"Can you try to take the shard, Penta?"
97264	{n}As you approach, the frost covering the goblin's body thaws, revealing a snowy white shard.{/n}
97265	"You know what... Norte's been thinking it over. Norte thinks he thought of something important. It was good that you saved the animals. Really good. You longshanks are the good guys."
97266	"Oh... I do not want to be driven mad again! Let someone else take it? Please...?"
97267	"May your path be easy and bright! I will never forget you, my friends."
97268	"Let me remind you that you are already carrying three shards, {name}. That burden is heavy enough as it is. Adding another shard might break you."
97269	{n}The shard sinks into your hand, followed by a wave of cold spreading through your body along with the recognition of the limitless possibilities you have acquired.{/n}
97938	"Akhshan — that sneaky old codger — mentioned Old Mo's prophecy. That old witch Mo always says that people from the outside world will come and decide our fate... I don't believe in prophecies, but let's say you're not monsters. Then who are you and what sorcery has brought you here?"
97939	"The easiest way is through the passage outside the village. It's covered in roots, though. You'll have to remove them, and that I can't help you with. You might want to visit the fey settlement. There's no love lost between us, but they know everything there is to know about these woods. They could help you. If they want to..."
97940	"Look, chief, we're asking nicely." {n}The blue flame in Sendri's eye grows brighter.{/n} "We don't have to be nice."
97941	"Assumption: that power is exactly what we are looking for."
97942	"Why are you lying? How and why would simple travelers come here?"
