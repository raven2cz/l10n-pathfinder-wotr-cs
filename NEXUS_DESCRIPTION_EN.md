## Description
Fan-made full Czech translation for *Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous* (incl. DLC).  
Initial pass was produced with GPT-5; we then performed extensive manual fixes and automated audits (embeddings, diffs). We also merged with Vlkodav’s DeepL-based work by line-level comparison using a large model decision.

## Editions
- **final** – Czech terminology (incl. `{g ... /g}`)  
- **final-en-terms** – English terms inside `{g ... /g}`, Czech prose everywhere else
