# Terminology Policy

Terminology is a long-standing debate (translate vs. keep EN). We therefore ship **two editions**:

1) **`final/` (default)** – Czech terms everywhere (including `{g ... /g}` tooltips/links).
2) **`final-en-terms/`** – English terms **inside `{g ... /g}`** for players who prefer original terminology, while keeping surrounding prose in Czech.

Rationale:
- DeepL (B) yields smoother long sentences, but may produce odd term translations.
- Many players prefer to keep canonical Pathfinder terms in EN (for guides/builds).
- Others prefer full Czech for accessibility. Two editions satisfy both groups.

Future:
- We may later maintain a machine-checked *TermMap* (EN↔CZ) to auto-validate `{g ... /g}` segments and ensure perfect consistency across updates.
